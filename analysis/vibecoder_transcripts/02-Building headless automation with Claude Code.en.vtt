00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:13.520
Good afternoon everybody. My name is Sedara. Um&nbsp;
I am an engineer on the cloud code team. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.600
today we're going to be talking a little bit&nbsp;
about uh the cloud code SDK and uh the cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.000
GitHub action that was just announced today.&nbsp;
Um cool. So a little bit about the agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.160
uh we do a little quick start for the SDK&nbsp;
uh just to give some examples of how to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.560
started and how to use the SDK. Uh we will&nbsp;
then dive into uh a live demo of the GitHub&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.560
action which should be fun. Uh the GitHub action&nbsp;
was built on top of the SDK. So it's meant to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.840
um a source of inspiration for the kind of things&nbsp;
that you can do using the cloud code SDK. Uh we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.960
then dive into some uh more advanced features of&nbsp;
the SDK. Um, and then we'll end with having all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.320
of you set up uh the the cloud GitHub uh GitHub&nbsp;
action on your repo so you guys can start using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.880
it and build on top of it. Um, cool. Actually,&nbsp;
before we get started, uh, can I get a show of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:14.160
hands here? How many people have used cloud code?&nbsp;
Okay, it's a lot of people. And, uh, of the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:22.320
who have used cloud code, uh, how many have used&nbsp;
cla or know what that is? Okay. Okay. far fewer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.680
people. Uh it's good to know. Um if you guys&nbsp;
don't have cloud code installed in your laptop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.520
uh that's how you get it. Uh I'd encourage you&nbsp;
to to install it in your laptops and follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.080
along. Uh there will be parts of this uh this&nbsp;
talk that will be beneficial to follow along&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:43.040
and then if you don't want to, you don't have to.&nbsp;
It's all good. Uh cool. So what is the cloud code&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.920
SDK? It is a way to programmatically access the&nbsp;
power of the cloud code agent in headless mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.200
Uh this is powerful because uh it's a new kind&nbsp;
of primitive and a new kind of building block&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.520
that allows you to build applications that just&nbsp;
weren't possible before. Um things that you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.320
do with with the with the SDK are like super&nbsp;
simple things to get started. Like for example,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.760
you can use it like a Unix tool. Uh the Unix the&nbsp;
Unixish tool philosophy is what really makes cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.040
code powerful because you can plug it in anywhere&nbsp;
where you can run bash or a terminal. Uh so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.560
can like use it in your in your Unix pipelines. Uh&nbsp;
you can pipe stuff into it, pipe stuff out of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.240
have like make like complex chains out of it and&nbsp;
stuff like that. You can then build CI automation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.960
on it. So you can have Claude review your code.&nbsp;
Some people actually get Claude to write new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.640
llinters for them too. So like Claude can lint&nbsp;
your code. If there are specific things that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.120
can't define programmatically, you can get Claude&nbsp;
code to do it. Uh and then we get into fancier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.520
applications as well. So if you want to build&nbsp;
your own chatbot that's powered by cloud code,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.960
that's certainly possible. Um if you want&nbsp;
cloud code to write you code in like a um a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.800
environment or a separate remote environment, uh&nbsp;
you can build those kinds of applications as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.720
Um and finally, the these are a few features.&nbsp;
We'll talk more about the features in the coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.320
slides. Uh and we have Python and Typescript SDKs&nbsp;
or like bindings for the cloud code SDK coming up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.360
soon. Uh so that should make it much easier for&nbsp;
you guys to consume it and build on top of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.160
Uh so let's jump into some basic examples. Uh&nbsp;
calling claude the cloud code SDK is as simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.600
as just doing claude-b and following it up with&nbsp;
the string that you want to ask claude. So in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.960
this example uh I'm telling claude to write me&nbsp;
a Fibonacci sequence generator. Um and if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:36.000
notice I also give it a d-allow tools write which&nbsp;
is uh a way for me to proactively give it access&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.120
to the right tool so it can write files to my&nbsp;
file system. Um, and then this is something I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.320
like doing too. Uh, piping logs to claude. So you&nbsp;
can do cat log cat app.log and then pipe that into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.960
cloud-b looking at logs manually. So this is&nbsp;
something I do quite often. Um, and as you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.280
see, it does a pretty decent job of summarizing&nbsp;
what the log failures were. Uh, similarly, uh, if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.960
you're anything like me, I just can't get myself&nbsp;
to understand the output of if config. I still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.040
don't know what it means, but Claude does and&nbsp;
Claude does it for me over here. Um, and finally,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.280
this is uh this is kind of what makes the SDK&nbsp;
tick, right? It is this is a we have an output&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.160
format. If you do d-output format JSON, uh, cloud&nbsp;
code will actually output things or its response&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.560
in JSON as opposed to plain text. And, uh, you&nbsp;
can parse this JSON and build on top of it. Um, so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.000
we we'll talk more about details for how this is&nbsp;
what what else you can do with this JSON, but uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.040
I wanted to throw that example out there. Uh let's&nbsp;
get into a significantly more complex example now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.080
uh which is the uh the cloud GitHub action. Uh so&nbsp;
cloud GitHub action was built on top of the SDK&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.880
um and it can be used to uh review code. It can&nbsp;
be used to create new features. It can be used to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.800
u triage bugs and so on. Um and uh this is also&nbsp;
open source. So I'll include a link at the very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.440
end of the talk. Uh so you guys can go have a look&nbsp;
at the source for inspiration for how to use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:17.280
Uh but for now let's jump into a live demo on my&nbsp;
laptop. So I have cloned a popular uh small like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.880
uh open- source quiz app for this for the purposes&nbsp;
of this demo. Um and we are going to fire it up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:30.560
just to see how that works and then we will tell&nbsp;
cloud to build something on top of it for us. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.320
I just did an npm start, which opened up my my&nbsp;
shiny new quiz app. It's actually pretty nifty. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.440
allows you to like choose a bunch of categories.&nbsp;
Uh how many questions you want, difficulty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.560
definitely easy for me. I suck at trivia. Um&nbsp;
type of questions. And then there's like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.680
countdown timer. So, we're not going to actually&nbsp;
answer these unless someone feels very strongly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.200
please shout out the answer. But I'm just going&nbsp;
to just fly through these uh just to show you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:06.080
guys how this how this like little quiz app works.&nbsp;
There we go. Uh not surprising. We got a great F,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:13.600
but that's okay. Um we So this was the little like&nbsp;
demo quiz app that that's open sourced. And if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:21.680
look at the issues for for this uh for this um uh&nbsp;
repo, we see a couple very interesting ones. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:29.360
there's one issue that says, uh, we should add&nbsp;
powerups for 50/50 elimination of options and skip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.360
questions for free. Um, because I suck at trivia,&nbsp;
I really like that feature and I want to build&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.480
it. Uh, and I before before this presentation, I&nbsp;
already installed cloud the cloud GitHub action&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.840
on my repo. So, it it's already available. Um, but&nbsp;
we'll go over like how to set that up uh uh later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:54.880
too. Um, okay. So, here's the issue. Um it has&nbsp;
pretty sparse details on how to implement this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.400
It's just literally a feature a wish list really&nbsp;
like a a wish feature. It's saying uh add a power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.400
up option in the config 50/50 elimination for the&nbsp;
skip question. It should avoid user points even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.200
even though the user the question was skipped. Uh&nbsp;
and user should be able to configure this from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.000
config page. So there's a lot of like creative&nbsp;
room for claw to do whatever it wants to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.680
uh in this case and I'm excited to see what it&nbsp;
actually ends up building. So what I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:30.320
do is say at cloud please implement this feature&nbsp;
and comment on it. So it usually does take a four&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.360
or five seconds for it to respond. And while it's&nbsp;
doing that for good measure we'll just also take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:41.200
this other GitHub issue. Uh this is talking about&nbsp;
uh a per question timer. So we saw there was like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:46.000
a global timer on the quiz app but there was no&nbsp;
per question timer. Uh so that's what this one's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:55.600
uh talking about. So let's go and say cloud please&nbsp;
build this. And now we have two things building.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:02.400
Um cool. So now when I get back to this tab you&nbsp;
see that claude responded with a comment on this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:09.200
GitHub issue. Uh saying that it's working. Uh&nbsp;
it also has a link to the job run which is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.960
GitHub action run. If I click into it and if&nbsp;
I actually like click on the logs, I'll see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:21.040
that it's doing a bunch of stuff. You can see all&nbsp;
this JSON being output. This is from the SDK. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.920
so we won't look at the JSON too much because it's&nbsp;
not much fun to parse it manually. But over here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.160
we can see that it also created a to-do list for&nbsp;
us. So claw is now going to actually go through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:36.800
this to-do list and try to implement uh implement&nbsp;
the uh powerup feature. Uh and similarly for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:43.120
question timer uh it's going to do something&nbsp;
something uh similar. Uh one more thing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.720
we should do here is um there are already a&nbsp;
couple pull requests that have been opened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:54.480
uh for this repo. Um and let's get claw to&nbsp;
review it or change some of these pull requests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:03.040
uh just just for fun. Uh there's this one which&nbsp;
is change background color to blue. All right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.560
I I actually think I like green better. So,&nbsp;
I'm just going to be like, "All right, Claude,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:15.920
please change this to green." Uh, this one is&nbsp;
fairly easy, and I'm pretty sure Claude's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:21.040
to do this, but I just wanted to show you guys&nbsp;
that it can also add commits for a pull request&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.320
that's already open. U Okay, so this is going to&nbsp;
take a few minutes to run. And while this runs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.960
uh, let's let's go back to the presentation,&nbsp;
and then we'll check up on how this is doing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:38.240
um, towards the end. Um, okay cool. So, let's do&nbsp;
a little bit of a deep dive on the features of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:47.200
SDK. Uh, when you call cloud-ba it has it has uh&nbsp;
it has no edit or destructive permission access.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.400
Uh, which is great for safety, but it's not great&nbsp;
for actually getting things done. uh which is why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:59.840
there is a d-allowed tools option which allows you&nbsp;
to to preconfigure cloud with uh any permissions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.520
that you think it might need in the future for for&nbsp;
for your given task. Uh so in this case the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:12.560
example you see that I've given it permissions&nbsp;
bash permissions to uh npm run build npm test&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:19.760
and the right tool uh which is a good set of&nbsp;
uh permissions because this allows cloud to uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.600
self-verify what's what it's writing uh and build&nbsp;
uh build build your project and test and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:33.200
continue writing. Um similarly for MCP if you have&nbsp;
MCP servers configured um you can allow list those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:40.720
MCP tools as well. So it's it's a very similar uh&nbsp;
very similar process. Uh then structured output&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:47.040
uh we already saw an example of structured output&nbsp;
both from the GitHub actions logs and uh also the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.280
the little screenshot I showed you earlier. But&nbsp;
there's two there's two modes here. There's stream&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.800
JSON and JSON. Um it it's it does exactly what&nbsp;
it sounds like. If you if you select stream JSON,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.760
it'll actually stream messages to you as and&nbsp;
when they're available versus JSON will just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:07.760
give you one giant blob of JSON at the end. U&nbsp;
and parsing this JSON and building on top of it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.640
is really how you can make use of the cloud&nbsp;
code SDK um and and create features for for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:20.080
your users. Um and then you can also configure&nbsp;
the system prompt. So you can do d-system prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.240
talk like a pirate and you can get cloud code&nbsp;
to talk like a pirate for the rest of your day.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:31.200
uh which is actually quite fun. If you haven't&nbsp;
done it, I'd encourage you to try it out. Um

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:38.640
we also have uh a few user interact interaction&nbsp;
features built into the SDK. Um and what that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:46.240
means is like the first one is uh is resuming&nbsp;
session state. So um when you uh when you call&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:52.720
cloud-p in in structured output or JSON mode, it's&nbsp;
going to return a session ID. Uh and this session&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.840
ID is useful because you can then reference the&nbsp;
session ID to go back to the same context state&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.880
that that claude had when it finished that&nbsp;
process. Uh so by preserving these session&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.600
IDs and keeping track of them, you can enable or&nbsp;
like build user interactive features where like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.880
you the user says something, you pass that on to&nbsp;
claude, uh claude returns a response and now you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.000
want the user to give feedback on that response&nbsp;
and that's how this kind of enables you to to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.600
build those types of interactions in your apps.&nbsp;
Um, and then the last one, and this one's actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:30.320
pretty interesting, and it's it's fairly recent,&nbsp;
too. Um, it's it's d-permission prompt tool. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.280
we talked a little bit about how to give cloud&nbsp;
permissions using the allowed tools flag. And that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:40.720
requires you to to preconfigure them in advance.&nbsp;
Uh, but what if you didn't want to do them because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:46.560
you don't know what tools cloud wants to what tool&nbsp;
tools cloud would want to use in the future? Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.200
in that case, you can use the d-p permission&nbsp;
prompt tool and offload the permission management&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:57.600
to an to an MCP server. U so you can ask users&nbsp;
in real time for whether they want to accept a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.920
tool or reject a tool and you can have an&nbsp;
MCP server kind of handle that for you as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.560
opposed to trying to predict which tools are&nbsp;
okay and which tools are not. Um, so this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:12.400
uh this is fairly recent and we'd love to get&nbsp;
feedback on this if you guys end up trying it out.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:22.400
Uh, okay. Let's let's go back to our demo uh and&nbsp;
see what Claude's done. Um, all right. So, this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:33.600
the power up issue. Uh, we can see that Claude&nbsp;
has actually gone through his to-do list. Um,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.760
okay. I'm going to open a PS. There's a&nbsp;
there's a link over here to create a PR.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:42.560
And I'm going to click that uh and see&nbsp;
what that gives us. I'll actually create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.800
the pull request too so it's easier&nbsp;
for us to review. Um I don't really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.400
know how this codebase works but we'll&nbsp;
still eyeball it just to see if you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.400 --> 00:14:00.240
it's doing the right thing. U so you see&nbsp;
some set power up stuff seems all right.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:06.960
Okay. There's like some configuration in the&nbsp;
main component. Um all right. Right. I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.600
what we should do and what would make this fun&nbsp;
is we should just get this branch locally and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.520
see what Claude did because there's no way&nbsp;
that we can actually figure out what it did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:25.200
in the short amount of time that we have. So, I'm&nbsp;
going to go back to my terminal, do a good fetch,

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:35.840
check out the branch that Claude just&nbsp;
created, and restart our process. Okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:44.080
Uh, awesome. Uh, it looks like we have a powerup&nbsp;
section now, uh, at the bottom of our config page.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:50.480
And it's a little check box. I like that touch.&nbsp;
Uh, we'll keep both of them on. And, uh, no, let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:57.760
select general knowledge. Uh, let's start playing&nbsp;
this game. Let's see what it did. Oh, sweet. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:03.680
we You see it has like this little 50/50 button&nbsp;
on the bottom left and a skip questions button on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.160
the right. Um, I'm just going to with 50/50&nbsp;
because I have no idea what the answer this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:17.200
is. Does anybody know what that is? D. Okay,&nbsp;
there we go. That makes sense. Cadbury. Yeah.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.160
Uh, all right. I'm going to&nbsp;
skip this one and then let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:30.320
just breeze through the other ones&nbsp;
for for sake of time. Um, all right.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.880
All right. Still got a still got an F, but&nbsp;
we got we got one one correct answer. Uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:44.320
which is better than zero correct&nbsp;
answers. Um, and yeah, uh, I guess

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.960
uh, yeah, it tricked us. Uh, that&nbsp;
was a good one. Um, but yeah, I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.680
it it seems like it worked. I think there's&nbsp;
definitely more we could do here. We could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.320
like show how the power like which questions&nbsp;
we we use the power upon over here. And there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:02.240
like definitely more we can do. But at the most&nbsp;
basic level, I think uh Claude was able to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:06.800
u do the task that we assigned it to do. Um&nbsp;
which is exciting. Like this is kind of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.280
power of the GitHub action because you didn't&nbsp;
really have to run this on your own infra. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.760
can just literally comment on a thread saying&nbsp;
please build this for me. It uses your your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:22.320
uh GitHub action runners and just like does the&nbsp;
thing. Um we let's also look at the PR that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:29.360
told it to change from blue to green. Uh it's&nbsp;
all hex code. So let's just see what it did in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:35.680
the commits. So you see there's two commits and uh&nbsp;
Claude has added this last one to switch it from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:42.080
blue to green. And it did it for all three of the&nbsp;
places where uh we uh where the color was defined,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:47.520
which is which is awesome. Um okay. Uh I'm not&nbsp;
going to go over the last one, the question timer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:53.040
because we we might run out of time. Um, but&nbsp;
this hopefully gives you uh insight into what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.040 --> 00:17:02.400
the cloud GitHub action can can do for you. Um,&nbsp;
let's let's go back to the presentation now.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.680
Okay. So, just as a recap, uh, the cloud&nbsp;
GitHub action um, as it's implemented today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.800
uh, is able to to read your code. It's able to&nbsp;
create PRs for you from GitHub issues like we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.120
just saw. It's able to create commits for you.&nbsp;
So if you already have a PR and you commit or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:22.720
you comment on it, it can add a commit to an&nbsp;
existing branch or an existing PR. Um it can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:26.480
answer questions. It doesn't have to do something.&nbsp;
It can just literally answer questions for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.000
If you don't understand something, you can be&nbsp;
like, "Hey Claude, how does this work?" And you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.880
can get it to answer questions and it can of&nbsp;
course review your code. Uh the best part of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.440
all of this is that you don't have to take care&nbsp;
of the infra. It runs on existing GitHub runners&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.720
which almost everyone has configured if you're&nbsp;
using GitHub actions. Um, so that that's kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:52.400
of the really nice thing about this is you&nbsp;
don't have to worry about any of the infra.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:58.560
Okay. Um, so how were actions built, right? Um,&nbsp;
I think I I may have mentioned that these actions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:04.480
were built on top of the SDK. Um, we so the SDK&nbsp;
does form the foundation of how these actions were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:10.400
built and then we have two other actions on top.&nbsp;
We have the cloud code base action. Uh this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:17.760
thin layer that just uh uh it it just implements&nbsp;
the piece which talks to cloud code and returns&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:23.360
the response from cloud code. Um and then we have&nbsp;
another action on top of this which is called the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.400
PR action. And this action is responsible for&nbsp;
all the fancy things that you saw um on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.040
PR. So it's responsible for making comments, for&nbsp;
the to-do list, for rendering it the right way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:39.280
uh for adding the PR links and things like that.&nbsp;
So um it it's kind of three layers uh in which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:45.520
it's built. Both the base action and the PR action&nbsp;
are open sourced. Uh so I would encourage you guys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.080
to go have a look uh you know take inspiration&nbsp;
from how that works and maybe that inspires more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.080 --> 00:19:03.200
ideas. Um yeah. Um yeah and then uh finally uh we&nbsp;
also um uh you guys can install the cloud GitHub&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:11.440
actions today. Uh the easiest way to do this is&nbsp;
to open up cloud code in a terminal uh in the repo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:17.680
that you want to install it in. Uh and once you&nbsp;
open up cloud code, just do slashinstall github&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:24.640
action. Um and that is going to present you with a&nbsp;
nice flow which uh guides you through configuring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:30.560
your GitHub action as well as merging it. So the&nbsp;
end the end result of this would be a PR which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.840
would be a YAML file for your GitHub action. Um,&nbsp;
and once you merge that in and you configure your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.160
API keys and things like that, uh, you're off&nbsp;
to the races and you can you can go ahead and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:47.840
start tagging Cloud and using Claude, uh, like&nbsp;
we just did right now. Um, uh, small caveat,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.120
if you're if you're a Bedrock or Vertex user, uh,&nbsp;
the instructions are a little bit different and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:58.320
a tiny bit more manual. So, uh, please have&nbsp;
a look at the docs. the docs uh are pretty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:07.600
comprehensive in uh in in in helping you set up&nbsp;
uh the GitHub action for both bedrock and Vortex.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:12.480
Uh cool. Finally, uh resources. Uh these are&nbsp;
resources for things that we've talked about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:19.280
today. If you want to snap a picture, uh go&nbsp;
ahead. Um the the the open source repos for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:25.760
both the base action and the cloud code action&nbsp;
are are here. Um and we we absolutely love your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:31.840
feedback as well. So if you guys have any feedback&nbsp;
on the SDK, on the GitHub action or on cloud code,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:38.640
uh please go to our um public cloud code&nbsp;
GitHub repo and file an issue there and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.920
someone will have a look um and and get&nbsp;
back to you. Um cool. That's all I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:52.400
for today. Uh thanks for joining me and I&nbsp;
hope you guys have a good rest of the day.
