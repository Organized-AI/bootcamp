please welcome to the stage chief&nbsp;
product officer of Anthropic Mike

00:27:18.781 --> 00:27:32.800
[Applause] [Music] Kger good morning everyone&nbsp;
and welcome to Code with Claude Anthropic's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.360
first developer conference i'm really happy&nbsp;
to see you all here i'm Mike Kger i am chief&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:43.760
product officer here at Anthropic i just hit my&nbsp;
one-year mark which in AI years is about like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:49.520
three years um but I'm having a blast um and&nbsp;
before this I co-founded Instagram um and also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.520
an AI powered news app called Artifact which is&nbsp;
where I first started getting exposed to a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:53.520 --> 00:28:00.160
these AI technologies i joined Anthropic because&nbsp;
of its founders vision building AI systems that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:06.320
are powerful as well as helpful and trustworthy&nbsp;
today that vision includes something immediate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:12.000
and concrete a commitment to empower developers&nbsp;
like yourselves to transform how work gets done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:20.480
and how companies get built this transformation is&nbsp;
about augmenting not replacing human creativity ai&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:25.840
agents are changing the way we work and the way&nbsp;
we innovate they're expanding what we can build&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:31.440
by removing bottlenecks that have limited human&nbsp;
productivity today you'll hear from our product&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:38.000
and engineering leaders as well as some of our&nbsp;
customers about how they're pushing the frontier&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.960
to give you a sense of what you can expect today&nbsp;
at Code with Claude you can attend three technical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:49.040
deep dives to transform how you build with&nbsp;
Claude and five sessions from leading players&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:54.720
already using Anthropics platform to reshape&nbsp;
their industries and dedicated office hours and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:00.720
workshops for hands-on experience but before we&nbsp;
talk about some exciting new API API capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:16.880
I have for you I want to invite a guest on stage&nbsp;
please welcome our CEO and co-founder Daario Amade

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:23.520
hey everyone uh I'm going to be back in 20&nbsp;
minutes for a fireside so uh I'll be I'll be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:30.160
really really brief with uh with this appearance&nbsp;
um I'm not one to uh hype things up so I'll just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.880
say this without any further fanfare i'm&nbsp;
happy to announce that as of exactly this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:44.400
moment we're releasing Claude 4 Opus and Claude&nbsp;
4 Sonnet on all of our relevant product services

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:54.880
now I know that we haven't had an opus model&nbsp;
in a while so just as a reminder opus is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.320
most capable and intelligent model and sonnet is&nbsp;
the mid-level model that you all know and love&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:07.680
and have been using for the last uh approximately&nbsp;
year that's a a good balance between intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.720
and efficiency um we tried to design both&nbsp;
of them so that there are there are use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:18.000
cases and times when it's optimal to use each&nbsp;
one so I will talk very briefly about the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.280
of them and then and then turn it back over to&nbsp;
Mike and then I'll be back for the fireside um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:31.360
uh first let's talk about Opus so it is especially&nbsp;
designed for coding and agentic tasks um it gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:38.640
state-of-the-art on Sweetbench Terminal Bench some&nbsp;
other things like like that um uh but I think in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:44.800
many ways uh as we're often finding with large&nbsp;
models the benchmarks don't fully do justice to it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:52.240
um customers who we've previewed it to have found&nbsp;
that it can do tasks that take humans up to six or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:59.280
seven hours autonomously um uh within Enthropic&nbsp;
I've seen some of our most senior engineers be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:05.920
surprised at how much more productive it has made&nbsp;
them and for the first time actually when I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:12.080
um you know looked and and seen clawude&nbsp;
written internal summaries documents and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:17.600
uh and and ideas you know in the past the quality&nbsp;
was often good but you could never really quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.000
mistake it for a human because it always had&nbsp;
that that specific style this was the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.800
time I actually got fooled where I actually get&nbsp;
got back and then you know I just read by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.160
name really fast and I thought it referred&nbsp;
to someone on the team and I'm like no the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:37.040
name was Claude um uh uh so I you know I think I&nbsp;
think there's a there's a there's a lot in opus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:44.400
um on sonnet um I think this will be for&nbsp;
many people a strict update for uh a a strict&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:50.400
improvement from sonnet 3.7 um at the same cost&nbsp;
and better intelligence many customers are simply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:57.360
uh uh switching directly from one to the other it&nbsp;
actually does just as well as Opus on some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:04.000
uh coding benchmarks but I think it's leaner and&nbsp;
more narrowly focused um I think in particular it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.040
addresses some of the uh feedback we got on sonnet&nbsp;
3.7 around overeagerness the tendency to do more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.920
than you asked for which is sort of the opposite&nbsp;
of laziness which was which was an earlier problem&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:21.040
and and some of the some of the reward hacking&nbsp;
issues so many of our customers have been trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:28.560
it out and view it as a strong upgrade from&nbsp;
3.7 for example um you know cursor cursor here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:33.440
has been uh one of our well-known customers&nbsp;
has been trying it and says saying this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:38.560
uh this is a state-of-the-art uh this is this is&nbsp;
this is a state-of-the-art coding model um it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:44.400
leapuh forward and complex codebase understanding&nbsp;
and we expect developers will experience uh across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:49.280
the board capability improvements um someone who&nbsp;
was playing with the model in person one customer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:55.360
said "What the f is this model?" Um it's really&nbsp;
it's really amazing so um uh I'll I'll leave the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:01.680
details to others but um the last thing I'll say&nbsp;
is we are going to continue to improve the Clawude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:08.640
4 series of models we expect to periodically&nbsp;
release perhaps minor version updates ideally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:14.000
even more frequently than we than we have for um&nbsp;
for uh for for Sonnet so it should be out there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.040
you should be able to try it on basically all&nbsp;
all the surfaces as of now except I think free&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:24.800
tier has has sonnet uh has sonnet only but all&nbsp;
the other surfaces uh all the API surfaces have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:38.000
both um so uh really hope you enjoy the&nbsp;
model and I'll turn it back over to Mike

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.200
thank you Dario two new models and you heard it&nbsp;
here first um we'll be seeing Dario again as you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.440
mentioned at the end of our agenda for a Q&amp;A where&nbsp;
I'll get to ask him the questions that are likely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:53.280
on your mind uh right now as well i'm personally&nbsp;
very excited for our customers to try both Cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:59.440
Opus 4 and Sonet 4 our teams have loved working&nbsp;
with them and we think you will too uh now that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:05.440
Dario has shared our big model news I'll talk&nbsp;
more about our detailed API roadmap our goals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.880
for building Cloud 4 were clear from the start&nbsp;
wanted to build powerful AI that safely introduces&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:16.080
new model capabilities continue to advance the&nbsp;
frontier for coding and AI agents and ensure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.880
that cloud becomes your virtual collaborator and&nbsp;
that's exactly what we've delivered with Opus 4&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:27.760
and Sonnet 4 like uh Sonnet 37 both Cloud 4 models&nbsp;
are what we call hybrid models that have two modes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.400
near instant responses and extended thinking for&nbsp;
when you need deeper reasoning i've been surprised&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:37.520
at how many customers use the deeper reasoning&nbsp;
even for non-coding and non-math use cases&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:42.960
opus 4 is great at understanding your codebase&nbsp;
and planning additions it's extremely effective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.440
uh and accurate with everything from migrations&nbsp;
to code refactorings and it's also the right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:52.560
choice for your most complex agentic workflows if&nbsp;
you found you've hit a wall with other models on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:57.520
your use case I think you'll be really pleasantly&nbsp;
surprised with what you can do with Opus 4 sonnet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:02.720
4 meanwhile excels at everyday coding tasks&nbsp;
app development uh and pair programming it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:08.080
also ideal for high volume use cases it perfectly&nbsp;
balances efficiency with performance think of it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:12.880
as your always on coding partner both models&nbsp;
are live today as Daria mentioned in Cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:18.800
and Claude Code as well as the Enthropic API&nbsp;
Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud's Vert.ex AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.920
these models bring critical new capabilities for&nbsp;
building AI agents they can use tools like web&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:28.800
search during their reasoning process which is new&nbsp;
handle multiple tools in parallel and when given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:33.200
access to local files it can actually maintain&nbsp;
memory across sessions to build knowledge over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.280
time and I'll talk with Dario a little bit about&nbsp;
that memory feature too later these aren't just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:43.280
incremental improvements they fundamentally change&nbsp;
what's possible for AI agents now I know the term&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.920
agents gets thrown around a lot these days i have&nbsp;
a personal uh joke which is how many minutes into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:52.400
a meeting can we make at Anthropic without&nbsp;
saying the word agents i think I made it 17&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.880
minutes or something uh but today what we're&nbsp;
going to focus on is agents beyond the hype&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:01.760
um I think what's really key is with the right&nbsp;
underlying models and the right underlying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:07.680
platform tools AI agents can actually turn human&nbsp;
imagination into tangible reality at unprecedented&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:13.920
scale and that's especially important for startups&nbsp;
and developers like yourselves i've been a founder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.800
myself when I think back to Instagram's early&nbsp;
days our famously small team had to make a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:26.320
bunch of very painful eitheror decisions we either&nbsp;
explore uh adding video to the product or focus on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:32.640
our core creativity either focus on our mobile&nbsp;
app and at first our single mobile app or uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:39.040
expand into the web it was all very single track&nbsp;
with AI agents startups now can run experiments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:43.600
in parallel learn from users and build products&nbsp;
faster than ever before which is something I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:49.200
heard from many of you all and AI agents can give&nbsp;
you the the founders of startups uh access to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:53.760
kind of strategic thinking that you might get from&nbsp;
a high-powered C CFO i see our CFO in the front&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.920
row here or head of product uh while they're still&nbsp;
building towards those key positions yourselves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:03.200
you're not ready for the make those hires but you&nbsp;
can hire uh Claude for some of those roles for now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.840
this transformation is no longer theoretical&nbsp;
i see it in my role and my work every single&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.840
day i personally spend a lot of time with Claude&nbsp;
maybe more time with Claude than my significant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:17.840
other it's fine uh in fact uh soon after I&nbsp;
joined Anthropic um I uh sat down with Amazon's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:22.480
Alexa team and they were eager to see how Claude&nbsp;
might become part of their vision for the future&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:27.840
of voice assistants at first my team planned&nbsp;
on presenting some slides talking points kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.680
of the plan we'd make for any other customer but&nbsp;
in the days leading up to the meeting I had this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:36.880
like persistent thought why not use Claude itself&nbsp;
to build a hands-on demo i thought it'd make the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:41.440
conversation more interesting and bring to life&nbsp;
the potential of Claude and Alexa functionality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:48.080
together the challenge was building this demo&nbsp;
without any access to Alexa's actual codebase we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:53.040
needed to create a prototype of the core Alexa&nbsp;
functionality while also integrating Claude's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:58.720
capabilities all within a tight oneweek timeline&nbsp;
really a tight one weekend timeline claude was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:04.000
the only reason we were able to pull this off uh&nbsp;
in such a limited time frame our threeperson team&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.720
split between San Francisco and London built a&nbsp;
functional prototype that showed the potential&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.800
and thanks to Claude the effort was a success i&nbsp;
even got to write some of the code you can take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:16.480
the engineer out of the engineering CT overall&nbsp;
but you can't take it out of me uh and do a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:21.440
of the front end development uh for the project&nbsp;
itself and of course a lot more work went into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:26.320
partnership after that first meeting um but Claude&nbsp;
is now one of the models that Amazon is using for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:30.480
Alexa plus uh which launched earlier this year&nbsp;
and is now rolling out and we were able I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:36.000
to really show the potential thanks to Claude&nbsp;
i've been watching this evolution towards ai&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.920
for years now uh when I first got a demo early&nbsp;
access of GitHub Copilot back in 2021 I called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.560
it the single most mind-blowing application of&nbsp;
machine learning I've ever seen back in those days&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.800
2020 we called it machine learning instead of AI&nbsp;
that was generations ago but it was really clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:56.000
the potential for this early glimpse of Agentic&nbsp;
AI i had an even stronger feeling last summer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.680
when we launched Artifacts i could describe what&nbsp;
I wanted for a mini app or visualization hit send&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:06.560
go grab coffee and come back to Claude having&nbsp;
built what I'd imagined and over the following&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:12.560
year it's become clear we're not just building&nbsp;
better tools we're creating genuine collaborators&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:17.600
and Anthropic's economic research uh confirms&nbsp;
what I've seen firsthand for the majority of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:22.480
use cases AI is augmenting people's work instead&nbsp;
of replacing it it's much more about tasks than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.360
entire roles and this is similar to the influence&nbsp;
that your best colleagues have the most talented&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.880
people you work with don't just execute they&nbsp;
understand your context they learn from experience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:38.560
and they know when to take the initiative versus&nbsp;
when to just check in great AI agents like the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.720
ones you can build on our platform should&nbsp;
excel at three capabilities they should have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:48.320
contextual intelligence understanding you and your&nbsp;
organization's unique context and continuously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:52.640
learning from experience not just following&nbsp;
instructions but comprehending the why and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:58.240
how that means models that learn and personalize&nbsp;
over time acquiring not just contextual but also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.160
episodic and organizational memory the way&nbsp;
I always put this to the team is your hundth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.560
task with an agent should be much better than your&nbsp;
first just like your hundth day with an employee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.800
should be much better than your first if you're&nbsp;
doing the right things around training second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:17.600
longunning execution handling complex multi-hour&nbsp;
tasks without constant management coordinating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.400
with other agents and humans as needed so you&nbsp;
have the context and then you can execute it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:28.400
over a longer period of time and third genuine&nbsp;
collaboration engaging in meaningful dialogue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:33.520
adapting to your working style and providing&nbsp;
transparent reasoning for their actions the key&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:39.280
insight here is that true agency doesn't mean&nbsp;
uncontrolled action and autonomy doesn't mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:44.880
uh just yoloing it it means intelligent autonomy&nbsp;
balanced with clear checkpoints maintaining human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:49.680
oversight for critical decisions while delegating&nbsp;
the smaller decisions that usually consume so much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:54.240
of our time now let's talk about those&nbsp;
capabilities we're announcing to serve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:58.880
those three needs we'll start with our new code&nbsp;
execution tool which is available on the anthropic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:04.880
API today the code execution tool gives Claude&nbsp;
an environment where it can run code enabling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:10.320
it to act as a data analyst that can transform&nbsp;
raw data into visual insights claude doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:15.760
just write code anymore now it can execute it it&nbsp;
sees the results and it can iteratively refine the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:21.360
results and the code to better highlight patterns&nbsp;
in your data here uh we'll show Claude analyzing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:28.240
sales data to see how a specific type of product&nbsp;
is performing claude can load your data set clean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:33.440
it generate exploratory charts and drill down into&nbsp;
anomalies all in real time as someone who started&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.160
their career as a data visualization analyst this&nbsp;
resonates a bunch with me and the code execution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:43.280
tool is even more powerful when combined with&nbsp;
the intelligence of the cloud for models this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:48.240
is what we mean by agency the ability to take&nbsp;
a complex task and see it through to completion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:54.320
these are the first models capable of handling&nbsp;
hours of tasks saving you half maybe even full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:59.040
days when you work alongside them and not just&nbsp;
writing code snippets but refactoring entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:04.320
code bases or implementing complex features&nbsp;
from scratch to give you a sense of the kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.720
of progress that we're seeing back in the day when&nbsp;
I started you could delegate maybe minutes of work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:15.200
to Cloud3 cloud3 meanwhile could work autonomously&nbsp;
for about 45 minutes without losing its thread&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:20.800
and now we're breaking into hours of work that&nbsp;
Claude can take on autonomously as you saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:26.080
earlier Rocketin mentioned that they ran Claude&nbsp;
independently for an incredible seven hours with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:30.000
sustained performance it can do it without losing&nbsp;
the thread especially as it's able to manage its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.440
memory and its own to-do list we've already&nbsp;
integrated this power where you work hopefully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:40.080
you're all familiar with Cloud Code our agentic&nbsp;
coding tool that we launched in research preview a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:45.920
few months ago we're moving cloud code to general&nbsp;
access today this actually started as an internal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:50.640
exploratory project by Boris one of our tech leads&nbsp;
this is his announcement post who wanted Claude to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:55.840
help them code directly in the terminal um very&nbsp;
early we still called it Claude CLI internally i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.600
think some of our best innovations like artifacts&nbsp;
and cloud code have really come from this kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:04.560
of bottoms up experimentation it's part of the&nbsp;
culture we try to foster at anthropic within just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:09.120
two days of launching it internally our usage&nbsp;
chart went vertical people talk about product&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.040
market fit we really often talk about product&nbsp;
anthropic fit like are people internally dog&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:18.080
fooding are they using it today most anthropic&nbsp;
employees rely on it for everything from routine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:23.520
coding to large-scale migrations i've watched some&nbsp;
of our most advanced coders run multiple copies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:28.080
of cloud code across multiple terminal windows&nbsp;
they're moving from just being engineers to being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:33.040
managers of several autonomous agents tackling&nbsp;
everything from simple coding tasks to complex&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:37.600
full stack development projects across multiple&nbsp;
code bases i realized I was using cloud code and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.840
I would run one in our front-end repo and one&nbsp;
in our backend repo and one of our cloud code&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.200
engineers is like you're doing it wrong just run&nbsp;
it in the root cloud can figure out where it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.080
going to be able to do it across all of them and&nbsp;
it does it beautifully and that's that's changed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.960
how I've used it already the vast majority of&nbsp;
of anthropic developers use cloud code daily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:58.000
to give you a sense of the impact it's had on our&nbsp;
team it's shortened our technical onboarding time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.560
uh to get engineers up to speed from two to three&nbsp;
weeks to two to three days i've really seen it how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.800
it can help you build an understanding of the&nbsp;
codebase especially a large monolith like ours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:12.480
very rapidly as it's fantastic at navigating code&nbsp;
and today we're bringing cloud code capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.080
directly into VS Code and Jet Brains with full&nbsp;
diff views and agentic workflow management built&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:23.600
into the editors and we're also introducing&nbsp;
the Cloud Code SDK so you can build your own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:29.040
applications on top of the same core agent as&nbsp;
Cloud Code as an example of the possibilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:35.280
of the SDK you can now run Claude code in GitHub&nbsp;
you can tag Claude in a GitHub pull request or an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:42.400
issue and it will respond to reviewer uh feedback&nbsp;
modified code or implement test coverage we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:46.960
also focused on what we call closing the loop&nbsp;
so Cloud Code is now helping build itself and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:52.720
demonstrates the power of self-improvement as it&nbsp;
speeds up its own development it's incredible how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:57.280
Cloud Code empowers developers like yourselves to&nbsp;
get more done i think back to when I was building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:01.120
Instagram our team was between two and six&nbsp;
engineers you know before we got acquired&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:05.040
and we were supporting two mobile platforms we&nbsp;
would have been able to produce prototypes in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:10.560
days and not weeks if we had agentic coding&nbsp;
products like this we've talked a lot about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:16.400
building performant reliable agents now agency&nbsp;
without responsibility is dangerous especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.920
when you're talking about something that's&nbsp;
self-improving like our cloud code uh product&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.800
and even more so in enterprise settings with&nbsp;
stringent security and compliance requirements&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:31.200
i think widespread adoption of agents will require&nbsp;
improving model discernment and judgment around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:35.760
confidentiality decision-making and coordination&nbsp;
so our models are already good at this but we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.920
continue to improve making sure that they know&nbsp;
what's confidential they know what to reveal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.800
um and that you can trust them in a production&nbsp;
setting that's why every feature that we build&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:50.800
around our models incorporates what we call&nbsp;
architectural safety checkpoints and controls&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:56.160
not just cart blanch agents pausing on major&nbsp;
decisions while users can define which actions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:01.600
need human approvals which we've also built into&nbsp;
the model context protocol they're robust against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:07.040
exploitation we test them we battle test them you&nbsp;
know uh a lot around things like prompt injection&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:12.160
and they're also transparent by design with&nbsp;
clear feedback loops and observable behavior&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:17.280
when you trust your agents to act autonomously&nbsp;
you're free to focus on in innovation instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:23.920
mitigation another area we've invested heavily in&nbsp;
is interpretability the science of understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:29.440
exactly what's going on inside the minds of AI&nbsp;
models dario recently wrote about the urgency of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:33.920
understanding how our AI systems actually work if&nbsp;
you read his essay the urgency of interpretability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:39.120
what he calls the race between model intelligence&nbsp;
and interpretability effectively we want to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.840
able to give our AI an MRI to see what what&nbsp;
it's thinking about and spot any potential&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:48.560
problems like deception so we can steer it in&nbsp;
the right direction when I joined Enthropic I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:53.120
was excited about how our research pipeline could&nbsp;
directly fuel our products take Golden Gate Claude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:56.880
i pushed the ship that's in our second my second&nbsp;
week at Enthropic because it didn't feel like it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.280
was just a good research paper it would make a&nbsp;
fantastic demo a visceral demonstration of how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.880
interpretability works in action when we amplified&nbsp;
the golden gate bridge feature inside the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:11.360
uh uh clawed neural network we saw that suddenly&nbsp;
we could see what it means to manipulate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:15.760
inner workings of AI and in this case make&nbsp;
it deeply obsessed with our favorite bridge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:20.880
uh the techniques that we used to create Golden&nbsp;
Gate Claude could in the future help us reduce&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:26.880
uh model harmful model behaviors or improve model&nbsp;
performance for specific domains and as we start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:31.600
employing virtual collaborators around companies&nbsp;
my hope is that we can lean on techniques like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:35.680
interpretability and auditability to be a&nbsp;
cornerstone of their work so we can figure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:40.960
out what they're doing at scale these are the&nbsp;
kinds of breakthroughs that that are going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:47.680
help us transform abstract research into tangible&nbsp;
product capabilities as you saw earlier we're now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:51.680
at the point where AI models can handle hours of&nbsp;
autonomous work and that's a capability that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:57.280
doubling every several months but raw model&nbsp;
capability alone isn't enough to unlock these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:02.560
multi-hour workflows in practice agents also need&nbsp;
access to real world information a connection to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:08.000
your existing systems and costefficient scaling&nbsp;
that's why we're launching four interconnected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.400
capabilities to help power agents with context&nbsp;
and help them scale so first off starting today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:19.920
you can now connect the model context protocol&nbsp;
directly through our API mcp is already being used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:26.240
by Microsoft Google OpenAI Block Atlassian Zapier&nbsp;
Linear and many more this was the dream list when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:31.120
we started creating the MCP protocol and we open&nbsp;
sourced it this was the dream list like maybe one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.880
day we'll get these companies to adopt it it's&nbsp;
less than a year and they they've all um come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:40.960
on board mcp acts as the universal translator&nbsp;
and connector for AI agents enabling seamless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:45.600
connection to your existing system without needing&nbsp;
to write a custom bespoke integration every single&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:50.400
time this lays the foundation of what could&nbsp;
become the agent economy where specialized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:57.360
agents have access to the data and tools they&nbsp;
need to tackle complex challenges second web&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:03.120
search gives Claude real-time access to current&nbsp;
information this is intelligent data augmentation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:09.200
that allows Claude to reason about current events&nbsp;
market trends and emerging emerging technologies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:13.200
it's really powerful in combination with the MCP&nbsp;
feature as well you can imagine searching across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.840
an internal knowledge source making some uh new&nbsp;
uh insights and then going off and searching the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:24.240
web to contextualize them third the files API&nbsp;
is available today in the API to streamline how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:29.520
developers access and store documents simplifying&nbsp;
development workflows we're also releasing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.520
cookbook to help developers build that memory&nbsp;
functionality that I mentioned directly into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:37.920
their applications these new cloud for models&nbsp;
have shown significant improvement in what we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:42.560
call self-managed memory so you'll find that this&nbsp;
works surprisingly well and it can be achieved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.200
with very little additional overhead by using&nbsp;
the files API as we demonstrate in that cookbook&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.520
you'll see claude both read and write to these&nbsp;
memory files and maintain contact context over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:58.160
time last power needs to be practical and scalable&nbsp;
we want to ensure that we can grow with you from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:02.640
prototype to production to millions of users&nbsp;
so that you're able to control cost and improve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:08.480
efficiency we want cloud to work for you as you&nbsp;
succeed and reach massive scale that's why prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:13.760
caching was our most requested feature one of&nbsp;
our most popular API features with prompt caching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:18.640
customers can provide Claude with more context&nbsp;
uh and background knowledge and example outputs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:25.040
reducing costs by up to 90% and latency by up to&nbsp;
85% for long prompts now every customer I talked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.200
to had one very clear request on prompt caching&nbsp;
that we're delivering today which is a longer time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:34.480
deliver TTL so in addition to the five minute TTL&nbsp;
we had out of the box with prompt caching today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:39.840
we're launching a premium 1hour TTL which is a&nbsp;
12x improvement that dramatically reduces cost for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:47.120
longrunning agent workflows this infrastructure&nbsp;
makes agent applications viable at scale so these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.960
capabilities all compound when we think about&nbsp;
building features into the API we don't think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:54.880
about them as one-off we think about how do they&nbsp;
complement each other how do they form a cohesive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:00.480
story claude can now execute code understand your&nbsp;
systems access current information on the web&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:05.200
creating the foundation for agents that operate&nbsp;
with full context even for longunning tasks and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:11.120
it can use the files API to maintain memory and&nbsp;
context during that entire execution everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:16.000
you've seen this morning is just the beginning&nbsp;
our road map continues to build on three pillars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.200
the first is industry-leading agentic tools and&nbsp;
applications so you can use cloud autonomously to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:26.800
handle hours of work knowing it can use the code&nbsp;
environment uh code execution tool to execute code&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:32.240
in its own environment cloud code is now generally&nbsp;
available integrating with VS Code and Jetrain so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:38.240
you can use the extensive SDKs to build your own&nbsp;
custom workflows including inside GitHub we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:43.360
continue to push on integrating more context in&nbsp;
the API our updates today allow you to bring the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:48.080
bring this context via the model context protocol&nbsp;
as well as build on real real-time updates from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:54.560
the web and execute uh complex workflows across&nbsp;
any data source and across anything in the API via&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:54.560 --> 00:52:01.280
MCP and finally efficient scaling as of today you&nbsp;
can use expanded 1hour prompt caching to optimize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:07.920
performance and cost at scale each advancement&nbsp;
builds on what we've discussed today with Cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:14.160
4 as the foundation Opus 4 for your most complex&nbsp;
uh agentic workflows Sonnet 4 as your daily driver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:19.680
for everyday intelligence we're enabling a new&nbsp;
class of applications code execution expands the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:25.280
hours of work that cloud can do mcp expands the&nbsp;
comprehensive information that cloud can retrieve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:31.680
and our platform updates ensure our models become&nbsp;
increasingly efficient for every dollar spent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:36.560
we're actively learning from developers like&nbsp;
yourselves uh to how you use these tools so please&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:41.120
keep the feedback coming i love API feedback if&nbsp;
you don't know this about me like absolutely like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:45.520
ping me uh I love hearing the feedback and how we&nbsp;
can continue to improve the API for developers or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:50.880
yourselves and MCP is a perfect example of this&nbsp;
it started as an internal idea and then began and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.880
graduated to community experimentation and now&nbsp;
it's a core platform feature if you watch the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:59.360
Microsoft Build keynote they're building MCP into&nbsp;
so much of their uh of their real infrastructure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:04.640
as well we want to create an ecosystem of AI&nbsp;
agents where we have the feedback loops to make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:11.680
them actually useful for you today we stand at a&nbsp;
major threshold our latest models combined with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:16.000
all the latest tools that we've released are&nbsp;
giving the seeds of a new era the future isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:21.600
about AI doing human work it's about AI helping&nbsp;
humans do superhuman work and I'm really excited&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:25.440
to build this vision together with you and I&nbsp;
can't wait to see the kinds of applications it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:30.000
powers for all of your companies and to show you&nbsp;
what's possible I'm next going to hand the mic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.120
to Catwoo from our product team to demonstrate&nbsp;
how accessing our new models inside Cloud Code&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:40.320
transforms your development workflows helping&nbsp;
you ship complex multi-day tasks in a single&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:50.560
conversation welcome again to Code with Claude and&nbsp;
thanks again hope you enjoy the rest of your day

00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:03.200
hi everyone I'm Cat Woo product manager for&nbsp;
Cloud Code as Mike mentioned we recently&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:09.200
launched Cloud Code our agent coding&nbsp;
tool in research preview claude Code&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:15.200
gives developers direct access to the&nbsp;
raw power of Enthropics models right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:21.440
where they work in their terminals&nbsp;
as of today quad code is generally

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:33.920
available throughout computing history&nbsp;
we've continually moved to higher levels&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:42.000
of abstraction from machine code to assembly&nbsp;
to highlevel languages with cloud code and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.280
increasingly agentic models we're&nbsp;
witnessing another step forward&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:54.000
developers are shifting from asking for&nbsp;
specific functions to describing entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:03.440
features guiding AI and changing how software&nbsp;
is built today we're bringing the new Claude 4&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:13.040
models to Claude Code making it an even&nbsp;
more powerful and capable coding agent

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:22.400
and on top of new models we're releasing several&nbsp;
new features in Cloud Code focused on making it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:31.520
a more versatile coding agent across your whole&nbsp;
dev life cycle first Quad Code now integrates with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:40.480
VS Code and Jet Brains bringing it to familiar&nbsp;
interfaces for millions of developers as Cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:49.760
Code works you can now see its proposed changes&nbsp;
in line in your editor we're also releasing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:57.920
Quad Code SDK which allows developers to use Quad&nbsp;
Code as a building block in your applications&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:06.400
and workflows the possibilities are endless&nbsp;
with the SDK to showcase these possibilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:14.480
we're releasing an open-source example of the&nbsp;
SDK in action with Claude Code in GitHub you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:21.280
can tag Claude directly on poll requests and&nbsp;
issues in GitHub and Cloud Code will respond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:30.000
to reviewer feedback fix CI errors and add new&nbsp;
functionality with these additions Cloud Code&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:38.160
now works everywhere you do acting as a virtual&nbsp;
teammate across all surfaces in the terminal for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:44.480
deep development work in remote environments&nbsp;
like GitHub for automated workflows built on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:53.360
the SDK and in the IDE for seamless review&nbsp;
all in Quad Code is a versatile coding agent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:58.960
for accelerating development wherever you are&nbsp;
whether you're working directly with cloud code&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:07.200
interactively or using it asynchronously great&nbsp;
my favorite part let's see what these updates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:14.640
look like in a demo i'm going to show Quad Code&nbsp;
tackling a real dev task in a product that many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:21.680
of you are familiar with we'll use Excaladrol an&nbsp;
open- source whiteboarding tool and ask Quad Code&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:28.720
to implement one of their most requested features&nbsp;
adding a table component how many of you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:34.160
gotten that feature request that's been on your&nbsp;
backlog for ages that you know your users would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:40.160
love but you just haven't had the time to build&nbsp;
this is the kind of task that we can handle much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:47.360
faster with cloud code normally for a task like&nbsp;
this I would set call to work make some coffee&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:52.880
catch up on email and Slack and come back when&nbsp;
the outputs are ready but I only have 10 minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:52.880 --> 00:58:01.520
with you all today so let's show a sped up but&nbsp;
real workflow here's the Excal repo open in VS&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:07.680
Code let's write a prompt to tell Cloud Code&nbsp;
our requirements we'll ask Quad Code to add a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:15.040
table component that supports custom dimensions&nbsp;
drag to resize and all of Excal's other styling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:22.320
options here's where it gets exciting quad&nbsp;
Code will first create a to-do list for how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:31.120
it'll approach the entire problem then we can see&nbsp;
that Quad Code will start to explore the codebase&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:39.040
starting with the file that we already have open&nbsp;
for context the best part of the ID integration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:45.040
is the ability to see diffs in line in the&nbsp;
editor this way you can see the surrounding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:53.680
code for more context so you can accept changes&nbsp;
with confidence or give quad code feedback&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:53.680 --> 00:59:01.040
we can approve each edit as Cloud Code works or&nbsp;
we can let Quad Code continue making edits with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:09.360
auto accept mode letting us balance visibility and&nbsp;
control in this demo we gave Quad Code the ability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:19.600
to make edits run lint and tests and make PRs so&nbsp;
Quad Code worked for 90 minutes on this task i&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:24.880
wish I could show you the whole thing but we need&nbsp;
to speed things up what you're seeing is actual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:35.920
unedited output from quad code an hour and a half&nbsp;
later and it's done it added table functionality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:42.720
wrote tests to validate the change and iterated&nbsp;
until lint and test passed this normally required&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:50.080
us to understand the codebase architecture and&nbsp;
how every single other tool was implemented&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:58.080
in this case cloud code is literally doing&nbsp;
hours of work for us pretty impressive right

00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:07.120
now now let's run Excal locally and&nbsp;
just make sure the feature works as&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:13.600
we expect let's check that we have a fully&nbsp;
functional table component by making a three&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:19.200
row by three column table great we can&nbsp;
reposition the table we can drag to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:28.880
resize we can change the border pattern and&nbsp;
color and we can add text to cells this also&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:42.320
integrates with Excal's existing UI all of&nbsp;
this was done with one prompt in Cloud Code

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.520
[Applause]&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:57.120
next we'll ask Cloud Code to use the GitHub&nbsp;
CLI to create a pull request for this branch&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:06.400
cool let's click in now we have our pull&nbsp;
request this is where the Quad Code SDK shines&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:14.720
it lets us build custom workflows on top of cloud&nbsp;
code including through GitHub actions for this PR&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:22.880
I'd like to update the docs instead of going back&nbsp;
to the IDE we can just tag at Claude and ask it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:31.440
update our documentation for us behind the scenes&nbsp;
this triggers a GitHub action that runs Cloud Code&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:38.240
claude comments on the PR as it works and it'll&nbsp;
it'll make a commit for us when it's done you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:46.000
also tag at Quad on a GitHub issue and I'll also&nbsp;
make a PR for you there with this feature Quad&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.240
Code meets users on even more surfaces where&nbsp;
they're already working devs no longer need&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:59.600
to context switch in their local environment and&nbsp;
you can even kick off runs on the go this is all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:06.720
built on the Cloud Code SDK beyond powering GitHub&nbsp;
actions we've seen customers do incredible things&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:15.520
with the SDK including running many Quad codes in&nbsp;
parallel to fix flaky tests increase test coverage&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:23.360
and even do on call triage cool it looks like&nbsp;
the action is done running and we can see Quad&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:29.920
Code updating its comments to let us know what it&nbsp;
did let's click into the commit and see cloud's

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:39.600
changes it updated the documentation for us in&nbsp;
our PR and committed it without us having to do a

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:50.720
thing in just 10 minutes you've seen quad code&nbsp;
tackle a complex tasks that would have taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:58.560
days to implement manually writing hundreds of&nbsp;
lines of code integrating seamlessly with Excal's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:07.440
existing features and doing hours of work for us&nbsp;
all of this is available to you today quad code&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:14.720
in GitHub actions powered by our SDK is available&nbsp;
in beta and you can install it by running a simple&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:22.720
command on the screen within quad the VS code&nbsp;
and Jetrains IDE extensions are also live in beta&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:30.640
just run quad from your IDE to install&nbsp;
last but not least our latest models&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:36.320
Quad Opus 4 and Claude Sonnet 4&nbsp;
are available to Cloud Code users

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:51.920
today quad code shows what's possible when&nbsp;
AI can truly understand and work with code&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:58.160
to build powerful agents whether coding&nbsp;
assistants or applications in any domain&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:04.320
you need more than just intelligent models&nbsp;
you need the right platform please welcome&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:08.560
Michael Gersonenhober who will show&nbsp;
you exactly how we're making that

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:20.320
possible thanks so much Cat and good morning&nbsp;
everybody thank you so much for being here&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.840
i'm Michael Gersonenhopper head&nbsp;
of product for the API platform at

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:34.880
Enthropic how many people here use AI generated&nbsp;
code already to write their applications yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:41.600
and how many of those are using AI at their core&nbsp;
feature delivery like everybody here that's what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:46.960
I thought most applications in the world will&nbsp;
be built by people already trying to solve the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:51.680
world's problems whether you pass Ble Code&nbsp;
whiteboard interviews or getting started&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:58.560
with Vibes we're all software engineers now but&nbsp;
writing code is just the start you need to more&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:06.160
quickly build stable secure and maintainable&nbsp;
AI applications and that's why we built the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:12.240
anthropic platform a complete toolkit designed&nbsp;
for building state-of-the-art AI applications&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:18.640
and agents our platform is already powering&nbsp;
most of the world's AI delivery in every&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:26.480
domain in finance Turboax helps millions of&nbsp;
customers confidently file taxes with federal&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:33.040
tax explainers in healthcare Novo Nordisk is&nbsp;
using Claude to draft clinical study reports in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:40.480
less than 10 minutes instead of 15 weeks and the&nbsp;
world's best coding assistants run on our platform&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:46.320
each of these companies took Claude's intelligence&nbsp;
and turned it into something uniquely valuable for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:53.600
their users at its foundation our platform&nbsp;
provides reliable access to Claude through&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:58.400
our model inference service which includes&nbsp;
the messages API and essential tools like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:04.320
prompt caching to optimize performance&nbsp;
and costs over 50% of all input tokens&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:09.200
are cached on the platform doubling the&nbsp;
effective context window for our models&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:15.120
notion can put vast amounts of your documents in&nbsp;
the context window but maintain snappy real-time&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:20.320
execution this lets them adopt your voice&nbsp;
for creative writing and virtually eliminate&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:30.720
hallucination starting today we're extending&nbsp;
the cash time to live from 5 minutes to 1 hour

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:38.400
your agents can now maintain complex context&nbsp;
across the entire user session without breaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:44.880
the bank but that's just a foundation to build&nbsp;
powerful agents our platform provides powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:53.280
building blocks as Mike shared we're releasing&nbsp;
two new capabilities the files API and a code&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:59.200
execution tool just like you and me there are some&nbsp;
problems that are easier to solve by writing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:06.240
script our platform lets your agents write their&nbsp;
own code in production just like you would these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:14.000
new features join existing components like web&nbsp;
search for real-time information and citations&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:21.120
for grounding responses in source documents when&nbsp;
Thompson Reuters provides analysis to attorneys&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:26.880
in co-consel it's critical that they ground this&nbsp;
in their legal research in case law not in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:34.160
models training data our platform also connects&nbsp;
your agents and your data and businesses business&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:40.640
systems through model context protocol mcp has&nbsp;
taken off within our developer ecosystem with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:50.160
over 3,000 integrations built by the community&nbsp;
whether your agent is accessing application&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:58.720
errors with Sentry triggering Zapier workflows&nbsp;
or creating Asana tasks the MCP connector enables&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:06.000
the model to interact with any tool data or app&nbsp;
your task requires and today the platform makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:12.160
it even easier by handling all the technical&nbsp;
complexity of tool and API calling for you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.680
one thing that I want to emphasize about the&nbsp;
platform is the composability of the APIs they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:22.240
building blocks that work together as well as they&nbsp;
work apart helping to solve unique problems that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:28.480
can't be coerced into a cookie cutter shape think&nbsp;
of Cloud as the architect and general contractor&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:34.800
for your agent it doesn't execute predefined&nbsp;
sequences or stack components randomly instead it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:40.720
intelligently determines which materials you need&nbsp;
in what order and how they fit together to create&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:46.400
something far more powerful than any individual&nbsp;
element let me show you what I mean when you build&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:51.760
an agent for complex financial analysis Claude&nbsp;
intelligently assesses the task and orchestrates&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:59.040
the right tools using MCP to access financial&nbsp;
data spinning up code execution for statistical&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:06.560
analysis searching the web for real-time market&nbsp;
data and grounding insights with citations for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:13.440
accuracy and compliance iterating and refining&nbsp;
based on results no hard-coded workflow no&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:18.320
brittle scripts just intelligent orchestration&nbsp;
that allows you to build powerful agent and is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:25.040
seamless and seamlessly adopt new capabilities&nbsp;
as our researcher research brings them to life&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:30.080
we understand that prompt quality can make or&nbsp;
break an AI application which is why we created&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:35.040
dev tools like the prompt improver and evaluations&nbsp;
along with new observability features that help&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:41.360
you get to production and scale faster today&nbsp;
we're already helping developers build faster&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:46.000
with resources like cookbooks and guides that show&nbsp;
you how to implement features like memory into&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:52.880
your applications in the future we'll adapt these&nbsp;
for programmatic access and host them directly on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:58.240
the platform so you can build even more powerful&nbsp;
agents that can research and remember on their own&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:06.240
in production everything we've built centers&nbsp;
on one goal helping you ship better AI faster&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:12.640
the anthropic platform isn't just tools it's&nbsp;
your path to building industryleading agents so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.040
thank you all for being here today with me at at&nbsp;
Code with Claude i'll be on the floor the rest of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.680
the conference but it's my privilege to welcome&nbsp;
Mario Rodriguez from GitHub to show you exactly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:33.920
what this looks like in production [Applause]&nbsp;
[Music] thank you thank you Michael and I am here&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:40.240
um thrilled to be with you all we at GitHub are&nbsp;
incredibly excited to be part of this energy and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:47.920
innovation and to share more about our deepening&nbsp;
partnership with Anthropic um this amazing team&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:52.800
everything GitHub does is anchor on two core&nbsp;
beliefs right number one is giving developers&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:59.920
choice and number two is giving them the best&nbsp;
developer experience at GitHub Universe last&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:07.840
year we kicked off the relationship with Anthropic&nbsp;
we announced Cloud Sonet 3.5 support in VS Code&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:14.240
and also in our conversational experiences and we&nbsp;
did this because we share fundamental belief with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:21.520
Anthropic that AI can be a powerful force and a&nbsp;
force multiplier for developers augmenting their&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:26.560
capabilities not replacing augmenting their&nbsp;
capabilities and freeing them up to focus on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:31.760
what they do best which is imagination and&nbsp;
creativity are of being a software developer&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:36.880
is being a whizzer since we haven't expanded&nbsp;
since then we have expanded the partnership&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:47.040
and experiences across VS Code Github.com and&nbsp;
our mobile app just to mention a few and today&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:53.840
I am delighted to announce that GitHub copilot&nbsp;
supports Cloud Sonet 4 and Opus 4 available right&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:53.840 --> 01:12:00.720
now we just pulled the trigger right when Dario&nbsp;
announced it and every one of those services

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:10.720
That is what SIM shipping is all about let&nbsp;
me tell you it's really hard to do i don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.560
know if you've done it with every application&nbsp;
that you have done but it's incredibly hard to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:20.400
do so thanks to all of the teams that make&nbsp;
that happen now as you all surely know the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:27.440
future of code is what agent an agent mode&nbsp;
in VS Code is our autonomous perprogrammer&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:34.320
that can perform multi-step coding tasks based&nbsp;
on your natural language commands we've seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:39.360
firsthand how having cloud's intelligence&nbsp;
directly within the editor truly helps&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:45.920
developers understand complex code bases um&nbsp;
get faster code to production and increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:51.840
their productivity without ever leaving the&nbsp;
environment they already know love and trust&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:52.960 --> 01:13:00.560
but even that right even that is singlethreaded&nbsp;
and in my opinion the future is multi-threaded you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:05.440
think about it you're in your editor it becomes a&nbsp;
waiting room you're you're going faster but it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:12.000
still a waiting room and that's why on Monday&nbsp;
we took one step further and announces GitHub's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:20.240
copilot coding agent now our coding agents this&nbsp;
are autonomous asynchronous peer programmer not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:27.680
pair anymore now it's your peer programmer&nbsp;
embedded directly into GitHub copilo's coding&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:34.720
agent is currently powered by you probably guessed&nbsp;
it cloud sonnet uh and you know the reason we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:38.560
chose that was very clear to me so let me just&nbsp;
walk you through three things that made that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:46.720
decision possible number one our evaluation showed&nbsp;
that cloud demonstrated three main strengths right&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:52.720
strong software engineering and coding knowledge&nbsp;
powerful problem solving and that's very important&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:57.280
because sometimes you have to go and look at&nbsp;
the code and find the right place to make that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:04.880
edit and then number three excellent instruction&nbsp;
following and specifically when thinking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:10.800
tools and MCP so when you're building for ejected&nbsp;
coding dealing with these things and large code&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:17.840
bases and system prompts you also need something&nbsp;
else which is caching right and that prom caching&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:24.560
bless you that prom caching support we get from&nbsp;
the anthropic API let us build these experiences&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:31.200
in a most cost effective way every token counts&nbsp;
and every token counts also on the price side so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:35.680
the more we save those the better experience we&nbsp;
could provide our customers now on top of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.960
cloud was already the most frequently selected&nbsp;
model in agent mode so once we put all of those&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:46.320
things together it was very clear to us that&nbsp;
cloud set was the right model choice for agent&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:54.240
coding in GitHub scenarios now with cloud set&nbsp;
4 we seen improvement in all of these areas not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:59.280
just aggregate benchmarks like sweet benchmarks&nbsp;
but more importantly on our real world evaluation&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:06.640
suites as well now our collaboration goes deeper&nbsp;
than this right it's not just about integrating&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:13.840
models directly we've been working closely with&nbsp;
Anthropic to officially adopt and scale MCP we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:17.920
combining intelligence if you think about this&nbsp;
like these models are incredibly intelligent you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:24.320
stack like three PhDs on them with knowledge so&nbsp;
how do you get knowledge into that intelligent&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:31.360
model well the answer to us is MCP and tools&nbsp;
and that really unlocks the next acceleration&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:38.880
of developer tools recently Kevin Scott that's&nbsp;
Microsoft CTO made the analogy that MCP is like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:46.320
the HTD protocol of the web and I completely&nbsp;
agree with him so if you have not adopted MCP&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:52.320
do it today right after this keynote go and play&nbsp;
with it it's that important it's the way you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:59.360
knowledge into these intelligent models now as&nbsp;
we step into this new era of software development&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:10.240
we're transforming GitHub's platform from an AI&nbsp;
infuse into AI native from creation to deployment&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:16.960
we envision this SDLC powered by an agentic&nbsp;
layer at the top of it that spans that inner&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:22.640
where you are coding and that outer loop those&nbsp;
asynchronous experiences and you are going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:29.760
an active collaborator every single step of the&nbsp;
way the reason why we say co-pilot is the human&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:38.000
is at the center and then there's agents helping&nbsp;
you that is why we're announcing a new partnership&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:45.040
that integrates what Kai just showed you cloud&nbsp;
code and the extensible cloud code SDA directly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:52.080
into GitHub's agent platform this opens up new&nbsp;
possibilities to customize cloud code remotely&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:59.120
invoke it from new surfaces that are embedded into&nbsp;
GitHub and our workflows again all on the GitHub&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:07.360
platform now we're already done a lot uh but the&nbsp;
journey with anthropic is still just beginning in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:12.960
our opinion we believe that by bringing together&nbsp;
GitHub's deep deep understanding of developers&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:20.880
and Anthropic's AI capabilities through cloud&nbsp;
and the platform APIs we will and we can unlock&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:29.280
a future that is more intuitive more efficient&nbsp;
more ultimately more human that human power is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:35.440
important so I'm excited to see what we continue&nbsp;
to build together and also what each of you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:43.920
builds with us so thank you so much and please&nbsp;
welcome back to the stage Mike Kriger thank you

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:54.880
sir hello again and thanks again to Mario&nbsp;
to Michael and to Cat um I love the GitHub&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:58.720
integration the last project I did I actually was&nbsp;
like "Oh I can actually just install cloud code&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:02.720
into a GitHub code space." And all of a sudden&nbsp;
I have Cloud Code against the repo that I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.480
already been building it was really great to hear&nbsp;
from each of them and hear all about the exciting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:11.440
work being done with Cloud so to close out the&nbsp;
show I'd like to dive a little bit deeper into&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:16.240
Cloud 4 our research direction uh and what&nbsp;
developers can expect next from Enthropic um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:23.360
so please help me welcome back to the stage Dario&nbsp;
for our one-on-one conversation welcome back Dario

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.960
hello again this is great this is like our&nbsp;
one-on-one in front of the whole audience this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:39.200
great um so Cloud 4 uh uh is out cloud Sonet 4 and&nbsp;
Cloud Cloud Opus 4 are available um what excites&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:42.800
you the most about the Cloud 4 models and how does&nbsp;
it change your thinking about what's possible in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:49.280
the next 12 months yeah so um I I think abstractly&nbsp;
the thing I'm most excited about is you know every&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:54.560
time you have a new class of models there's like&nbsp;
more you can do with it right so uh uh you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:59.680
we're we're we're going to be releasing uh models&nbsp;
after Claude 4 there'll probably be a Claude 4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:05.040
at some point just like we did with uh with Sonnet&nbsp;
uh uh 3.5 and I think we're just at the beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:10.400
of of of of you know what what what we can do&nbsp;
with the new the new generation of model in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:16.400
terms of tasks i think the autonomy is going to&nbsp;
go uh uh is going to go much further than it has&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:22.000
already just the ability to give you know set&nbsp;
your model free and and give it the ability to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.120
you know do something for for a long period of&nbsp;
time i think we're I think we're very much very&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:32.880
much still still at the beginning of that um uh&nbsp;
I'm I'm actually increasingly excited about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:38.560
models for cyber security tasks i mean you can&nbsp;
think of cyber security as like a a subset of of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:44.160
of of coding tasks but they tend to be higherend&nbsp;
coding tasks and so I think we're maybe finally&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:49.280
hitting the threshold for that and then as a&nbsp;
as a former biologist I'm I'm always excited&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:55.360
about use of the models for uh for you know&nbsp;
biomedical and kind of kind of kind of detailed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:55.360 --> 01:20:01.360
uh scientific research work which I think opus&nbsp;
and opus in particular is going to be good opus&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:05.680
in particular I think is going to be particularly&nbsp;
particularly strong at that um it really connects&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:09.760
I think to machines of loving grace so how does&nbsp;
cloud 4 fit into that trajectory overall i like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:13.600
to joke that people think of Machines of Loving&nbsp;
Grace as an essay and I think of it as a product&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.920
road map for the next few years and curious how&nbsp;
Cloud 4 fits into that journey yeah it was sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:22.240
of a product road map that I wrote without knowing&nbsp;
how to how to actually get to it and and kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:29.760
said all right guys then this is your work this&nbsp;
is your job um uh yeah uh you know we're I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:35.840
we're increasingly thinking about on the biology&nbsp;
side of things and and software is part of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:40.720
right where and you know increasing amount because&nbsp;
biology increasingly involves data even involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:46.720
data 10 years ago when when I uh when I was&nbsp;
a biologist uh uh I I think I think I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:50.960
more and more of it is is is going to be okay we&nbsp;
have these models that know a lot about biology&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:55.920
and they can help write code and so if you're a&nbsp;
computational biologist I think these models will&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:59.760
will really accelerate what what you can do and&nbsp;
you know we have a number of customers who are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:03.840
who are who are trying out the models for for&nbsp;
these tasks i guess we'll we'll get to that in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:08.960
a bit yeah I think uh one of the first hackathons&nbsp;
we did after we uh released MCP somebody hooked&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:13.120
up MCP to one of those like plotters that so to do&nbsp;
drawing and so cloud could draw for it's actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:17.520
really fun to like see what cloud draws for itself&nbsp;
but it was like the first one was like MCPs don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:22.080
just have to be connecting to digital systems they&nbsp;
could also be connecting to the real world so like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:26.640
when you'll be able to drive lab equipment VMCP I&nbsp;
think is an interesting uh question for the soon&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:35.600
we'll be able to test Claude by connecting it to&nbsp;
a polygraph yeah I love that idea are you lying

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:41.040
who needs interpretability&nbsp;
when we have the polygraph um

01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:45.120
uh you mentioned that moment where you were&nbsp;
you know convinced that Claude the claude&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:50.160
written content was was human written um any other&nbsp;
breakthrough moments in watching us all you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:55.120
uh dog food uh Cloud 4 or even try it yourself&nbsp;
that made you realize this model felt different&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:59.680
um you know I I didn't actually understand I&nbsp;
didn't actually understand the details but like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:04.080
there were several people in our side there was&nbsp;
a moment a few weeks before the model launched&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:09.040
where someone said "Oh my god this model just&nbsp;
like oneshotted this like incredibly difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:14.000
performance engineering task." And and no model&nbsp;
had ever had ever done anything like that before&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:19.600
i I I will say that there there's there's this&nbsp;
almost almost like superstitious process in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:24.800
model development where like it it it it somehow&nbsp;
all comes together at the last moment even if the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:30.080
training plot process is all planned out like just&nbsp;
some of the models abilities maybe it's something&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:34.640
about their interaction with people maybe it's&nbsp;
something about like just making it the last bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:39.840
better matters maybe it's people getting used&nbsp;
to the model and prompting it but but you you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:44.880
always find the the early versions of the model&nbsp;
um you know people are struggling to figure out&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:49.200
how to use them and then and then you finally get&nbsp;
to a point and people are like this works for me&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:53.840
all the time and there's that there's that alchemy&nbsp;
that happens somehow always the last moment if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.080
read uh the Creativity Inc by Ed Catmol he talks&nbsp;
about the same process with all the Pixar movies&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.920
like they're really bad until like two days before&nbsp;
they're supposed to go out and I feel the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:05.040
way about our models not that they're really bad&nbsp;
but they're like there's like they're not quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:08.800
there and then suddenly they click and we're&nbsp;
like I can't wait to get this out to people it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:14.160
it doesn't make it doesn't make any sense because&nbsp;
like the training process is uniform and you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:18.240
you know you you would think that that it doesn't&nbsp;
work that way that it's all a rational process&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:23.280
but it's absolutely not there's no point on the&nbsp;
RL curve at all that that they come together it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:27.360
comes together at the last minute i don't know why&nbsp;
it's a real moment um many people in the audience&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:32.000
are developers here and a question that I know has&nbsp;
come up internally as people you know think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.680
uh how AI is developing is which parts of the&nbsp;
software engineering job will AI take over um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:41.360
and what becomes more important in a world where&nbsp;
we have autonomous agents being able to do do a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:47.280
lot of software engineering yeah um so probably&nbsp;
like many people here I I read with great interest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:52.960
uh Steve Jay's blog post a couple months ago uh&nbsp;
revenge of the junior developer uh he had some&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:57.840
uh he had some similar blog posts uh he had some&nbsp;
similar blog posts around that actually uh came in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:05.200
to visit us even um uh um uh uh and and that laid&nbsp;
out I think the vision of where things are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:09.920
maybe maybe even better than I could which is that&nbsp;
we're gradually go we're gradually going to more&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:14.480
and more autonomy of the models right we had this&nbsp;
phase where you would do basically autocomplete&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:20.400
now there's this thing that I guess people have&nbsp;
called vibe coding um uh uh uh and and you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:25.360
then then we're going more to kind of like you can&nbsp;
dispatch the agents to to do things and I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:29.360
with with claude code we're going to go go more&nbsp;
in the direction of you know you can dispatch the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:33.760
agents to do things and I'm sure we'll have other&nbsp;
product surfaces that that that allow you to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:38.720
that as well and I think we're we're heading to a&nbsp;
world where a human developer can kind of manage a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:43.760
fleet of agents and say you go off and do this you&nbsp;
go off and do this you go off and do that but but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:48.640
I think continued human involvement is going to&nbsp;
be going to be important for the quality control&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.360
to make sure they do the right things to get the&nbsp;
details right and so you know working together&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:57.280
on both the models and the product surface around&nbsp;
it to get the details right is going to be really&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:01.680
important i think it's also highlighted to me it&nbsp;
makes the stuff that is inefficient in your work&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:05.920
way more painful because it's taking you away&nbsp;
from like this flow of building and so at least&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:10.560
it's made me realize like where we're spending&nbsp;
too much time on crossunctional alignment and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:15.120
you know road mapping when like we just should&nbsp;
be trying to get more building so it's I've I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:20.160
it's become more painful as the engineering part&nbsp;
has has been sped up as well um so there's endless&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:25.360
debate uh you know around the industry around you&nbsp;
know uh bigger models or smaller architectures&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:30.960
which will win in the long run um you're famous&nbsp;
for you know popularizing and and pioneering the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:36.080
scaling laws paper what's your current take on&nbsp;
you know the extreme being is pre-training dead&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:40.400
is pre-training all that matter still and its&nbsp;
role you know relative to to post-training i&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:46.080
mean without getting too specific I would say that&nbsp;
you know the Clawed 4 models embody advances in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:51.520
both pre-training and post-training um so we're&nbsp;
continuing to see the pre-training scaling laws&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:57.360
work the way that they've worked before um uh and&nbsp;
we're also continuing to see continued advances in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:02.480
uh post-training and and they kind of they kind of&nbsp;
complement each other uh and I I think we're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:07.760
to continue seeing advances in both of those i&nbsp;
think we're also going to continue to scale up so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:13.120
we have these these multiple trends these multiple&nbsp;
sources of exponential growth and they're they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:17.680
all going to compound with each other right that's&nbsp;
that's why I think all of this is going to go very&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:22.320
fast one of the reasons I liked Jiega's blog post&nbsp;
is that it was someone who was not me repeating&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.200
the mantra of like it's only going to be a year&nbsp;
or two until until these things are like you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:32.720
are basically peers to us it's insane that 37&nbsp;
was just in February right it's it feels like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:37.040
a year ago but it was just three months ago i I I&nbsp;
know it i know it feels like it's like oh this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:40.720
this feels like an obsolete model or something&nbsp;
and you know it was it's less is like two and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:45.680
a half months or something it's like the the time&nbsp;
scales are the time scales are compressing and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:51.760
often say that uh being in the AI field I will go&nbsp;
on a very brief digress be being in the AI field&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:57.840
it feels like you're getting on a a spaceship&nbsp;
from leaving Earth at relativistic speeds and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:02.800
uh you know one day you wake up and you know it's&nbsp;
like you know one day on your spaceship two days&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:07.680
on Earth so you have to take in the news of two&nbsp;
days it accelerates one day on your spaceship&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:11.440
three days on Earth and and and you know that&nbsp;
that's that's just what it feels like being&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:16.080
being on this ride that resonates i've heard the&nbsp;
metaphor before but it absolutely does um maybe on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:19.760
the post- training front one of the things that I&nbsp;
got really excited about seeing developed in Cloud&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:23.280
4 has been this concept of memory and having&nbsp;
the the model being able to manage it memory&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:28.000
maybe talk a sec about why that's important&nbsp;
and what that kind of enables uh sorry repeat&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.160
the question like for uh the model to be able to&nbsp;
manage its own memory and be able to handle those&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:38.320
long horizon tasks as well yes yes we have found&nbsp;
that to be uh very useful i think one one place&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:43.200
we found it to be useful is Pokemon right um uh&nbsp;
where the model's able to like remember its state&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:50.160
but you know presumably it's it's useful for many&nbsp;
things other than just Pokemon um uh uh but uh um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:55.440
no I think I think it's great that you know the&nbsp;
model you know just as a human would like when I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.560
thinking I'll write a bunch of notes and uh you&nbsp;
know then I'll like recall those notes at a later&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.920
time or you know that there's just a lot of lot&nbsp;
of intermediate work that I have to do that that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:10.320
you know and models do that to some extent when&nbsp;
they when they reason when they have you know like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:16.720
our our reasoning traces but uh you know not not&nbsp;
everything I do can be incorporated in one scratch&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:22.240
pad right there's like presentations there's um&nbsp;
you know individual documents that I that I write&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:28.000
and so models are the same right the the idea for&nbsp;
them to kind of you know be able to create files&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.000
to do things with those files to load data and to&nbsp;
kind of seamlessly interle those things right the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:40.080
the one of the new features that we have is this&nbsp;
this kind of interled re interled reasoning and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:47.120
taking actions and some of those actions can be&nbsp;
storing data recalling data again the affordances&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:52.320
that the models have are gradually converging&nbsp;
towards the affordances that a human has which&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:57.680
I think is is the way that it should be one of&nbsp;
my mind-blowing moments in Cloud 4 so far was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:02.560
we added like basically a to-do list scratch pad&nbsp;
to cloud code and just watching it turn through&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:06.480
the to-do list and then as it thought of more&nbsp;
things to do add to the to-do list check things&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:10.800
off strike out what was no longer relevant it&nbsp;
really mimicked I think how people managed their&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:15.600
own work and how they think about uh completion&nbsp;
along the way and then the interled reasoning uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:20.320
and tool use as well i saw a write up this morning&nbsp;
on Mac stories where it was using a tool it was an&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:24.240
MCP and it hit a rate limit with the backend MCP&nbsp;
server and because it was doing the reasoning it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:28.240
was long I was like hm I probably hit a rate limit&nbsp;
let me try this other approach to do this as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:33.280
and so like that ability to reason and remediate&nbsp;
as part of tool use I think is is really powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:39.680
um I'd love to touch on race at the top so um uh&nbsp;
safety and and capabilities are often you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:44.400
uh thought of as being at odds with each other and&nbsp;
your thesis is exactly the opposite and that these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:47.760
two things can move in tandem i found that very&nbsp;
inspiring and one of the reasons I joined here&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:53.280
but maybe touch on how you think of of race to the&nbsp;
top yeah so you know I think I think it it it uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:58.800
applies to things you know from the from the uh&nbsp;
from the very mundane and simple and commercial&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:04.480
to kind of you know the grand directions that&nbsp;
that that that that that that AI is going in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:09.280
the future um so you know I you know I think&nbsp;
I think when we when we talk to customers we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:14.000
have a number of customers who you know care a&nbsp;
lot about making sure that the behavior of their&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.360
AI models is predictable that it's trustworthy&nbsp;
um uh and I think that's aligned with what some&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:25.120
of we're what what we're trying to do in the long&nbsp;
term for uh you know making sure that models in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:30.880
a more grand sense stay in line with human intent&nbsp;
um so there's there's this nice there's this nice&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.040
synergy here and you know I think whenever&nbsp;
we're able to do so whenever we think it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:40.560
reasonable or responsible to do so we do want to&nbsp;
provide tools for the community so M MC MCP MCP&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:46.400
is an example of that um I I myself was actually&nbsp;
surprised at the the pace at which everyone seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:52.320
to have standardized around around MCP i mean it&nbsp;
was it was very strange we released it in November&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:58.320
i wouldn't say there was like a huge reaction&nbsp;
immediately but then but then within 3 or 4 months&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:03.200
you know it kind of become it kind of become the&nbsp;
standard again there's again this this feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:09.040
of like being on the spaceship accelerating from&nbsp;
Earth and and and you know experiencing you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:14.400
larger and larger time time dilation constants&nbsp;
yeah um where it's you know like you know think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:18.720
of like USB and other standards you know think&nbsp;
of like standards in the '9s or the two like you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:22.240
know this would take it would take years for&nbsp;
people to converge on something yeah and even&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:26.240
in talking to other participants in the industry&nbsp;
around MCP they're like we don't want to slow down&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:30.800
whatever is working on MCP like we do want like&nbsp;
some you know help on steering but like this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:34.240
you've captured lightning in a bottle let's make&nbsp;
sure it becomes the new protocol and the standard&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:39.840
by which we interoperate agents as well um uh&nbsp;
maybe tied together the race to the top i loved&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:44.400
your urgency of interpretability essay you have a&nbsp;
background in neuroscience as well can you talk a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:50.160
little bit about how you see the co-development of&nbsp;
interpretability and um machine intelligence yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:58.000
so um you know I think 10 years ago uh many people&nbsp;
thought that neuroscience would tell us about how&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.760
to do AI um uh and indeed there you know are a&nbsp;
number of former neuroscientists in the field i'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:08.640
not I'm not the only one there you know there are&nbsp;
other lab leaders some who have that uh who have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:14.560
that background um and you know I found at a high&nbsp;
level there's some inspiration but I wouldn't say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:19.280
I've said oh you know this is how the you know&nbsp;
this thing we know from the hypothalamus we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:24.720
use for you know for for for making these models&nbsp;
it's it's all been pretty much from scratch but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:30.960
interestingly things have gone the other way more&nbsp;
which is that using interpretability we're able&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:36.720
to see inside models and although of course&nbsp;
they're not ex made in exactly the same way&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:42.000
the human brain is at at a you know the a kind&nbsp;
of superficial level there's there's a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:49.200
differences a lot of the conceptual patterns we&nbsp;
have found inside models sometimes they then get&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:54.880
replicated in replicated in neuroscience research&nbsp;
there was something about like high low frequency&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:54.880 --> 01:33:02.000
detectors in vision um that uh was found via&nbsp;
interpretability via via one of one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:08.560
people on Chris Ola's team and then a couple years&nbsp;
later a neuroscientist actually replicated it in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:14.960
in animal brains um the idea that for example&nbsp;
vision models separate out you know they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:22.240
one path that that tends to correspond to color&nbsp;
and you know another path that corresponds to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:29.200
uh you know uh h a brightness or to the boundaries&nbsp;
between objects these seem to be natural&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:33.760
distinctions in the world right that are that are&nbsp;
kind of there to be discovered and anytime you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:39.520
have any kind of abstract learning system whether&nbsp;
it's artificial or biological you kind of discover&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:43.200
the same thing so it's very interesting i'm really&nbsp;
curious how the circuits paper ends up affecting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:48.800
neuroscience research as well um let's move into&nbsp;
the 5 to 10 year time horizon um to the extent&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:52.560
that that is even possible in AI as as we move&nbsp;
relativistically maybe relativistically that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:56.880
probably one year in real time um when do you&nbsp;
think there'll be the first billion dollar company&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:07.440
with one human employee 2026 yeah I absolutely&nbsp;
buy that um do you have any advice for people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:12.720
building with Claude um for the next year how to&nbsp;
think about building at that frontier as well yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:18.240
um I you know I think there's like a lot of very&nbsp;
specific things you could say about like how about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:24.640
how to use the models but I feel like because of&nbsp;
this whole like relativistic time dilation thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:31.680
this like speeding things up like almost all the&nbsp;
advice is drowned out by like one sentence which&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:36.800
is or maybe two words which is just be ambitious&nbsp;
um like build something that's greater than you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:42.080
think is is possible and even if it doesn't&nbsp;
quite work yet another model will come out&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:45.680
in the next generation which right now is three&nbsp;
months but like probably it's going to go down&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:50.800
to two months then one month and you know then&nbsp;
then if I want to come up this year maybe I'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:55.040
be giving advice that's like oh you know don't&nbsp;
build anything today you know we're releasing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:01.040
something today but by tonight it'll be you know&nbsp;
you won't want to be building with this tonight&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:05.360
i talked to a founder who started a company two&nbsp;
years ago in the sort of autonomous AI coding&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.760
agent space and he basically tried every single&nbsp;
model and his startup wasn't working and then it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:13.280
was actually 37 where he's like my startup works&nbsp;
now and it was the same thing of like this thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:17.520
that I was trying that was really hard all of a&nbsp;
sudden is now um possible but hitting your head&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:23.520
against the wall actually sometimes can be useful&nbsp;
because you put all the other pieces in place and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:28.240
and everything works except the model and then&nbsp;
when the model works it's almost like you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:32.640
built something that's like more robust than it&nbsp;
needs to And that can be like a positive property&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:36.960
um so so you know as much as I joke about like&nbsp;
oh you should you know you can just wait for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:40.960
next model actually hitting your head against the&nbsp;
wall as long as it's something that's like almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:46.080
possible if it's not like you know like three&nbsp;
years out from from what's possible um I think it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:50.240
can actually be productive we saw that even with&nbsp;
advanced research internally like our our research&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.720
and cloud skills team had built a prototype of&nbsp;
this the model kind of lost its way it wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:58.960
good at using tools and then with 37 especially&nbsp;
with cloud 4 I think you'll find that it does&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:02.480
advanced research really really well as well and&nbsp;
it's because we were trying and kind of failing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:06.720
along the way as well yeah it's it's almost as if&nbsp;
you want to run your you want to run your startup&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:11.680
as like speculative execution against the next&nbsp;
model right there's some kind of like I don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:16.400
I love that yeah I think that's exactly right um&nbsp;
all right so last question to wrap up um for many&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:20.640
of us today um who aren't Dario we couldn't have&nbsp;
imagined the progress that AI has made and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:24.720
rapid pace of change what are you most excited&nbsp;
about for the coming year and in the next five&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:33.600
years um yeah so uh I think for in the next coming&nbsp;
year uh we are going to see incredible things in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:39.840
in in code i would refer again to kind of the you&nbsp;
know taking where we are with cloud code and where&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:44.960
we are with the coding models and going from there&nbsp;
to kind of to kind of the agent fleets um I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:49.680
this will have an interesting effect in the world&nbsp;
which is I don't know that we've thought carefully&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.720
like from an economic or business perspective&nbsp;
about what happens when the cost of producing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:54.720 --> 01:37:00.400
software goes down it's kind of an assumption&nbsp;
an article of faith that you only make software&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:05.600
if it's only worth it to make it if millions of&nbsp;
people use it or at least hundreds of thousands&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:11.040
or maybe tens of thousands like you wouldn't make&nbsp;
you you know you you you you like wouldn't make a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:16.080
whole piece of software for this event right like&nbsp;
you might throw together something but like when&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:20.560
it just becomes really cheap when it costs you&nbsp;
20 cents to like oh let's just let's just throw&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:25.840
let's just throw together something that you&nbsp;
know you know changes you know ch changes my&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:30.080
vision for this particular event or something&nbsp;
like that um uh I think the world is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:35.440
be very different when these things can be made ad&nbsp;
hoc on a on a one one one oneoff basis in like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:40.160
few seconds for for less than a for for for less&nbsp;
than a dollar what are what is the role of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:45.280
developer there what is the role of businesses&nbsp;
what is the role of startups um and what is what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:49.600
is the experience of the of the you know of the&nbsp;
of the people using it i think we don't know the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:54.000
answer to any of those questions so that's&nbsp;
very interesting on the on the fiveyear time&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:00.400
scale I will return again to biology i think the&nbsp;
biomedical stuff will not be revolutionized in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:06.080
next year because it's it's kind of you know slow&nbsp;
to slow to happen but uh yeah yeah I hope that uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:11.760
five years from now we will have uh vanquished uh&nbsp;
many of the diseases that now uh that now exist i&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:14.800
love we'll leave it at that unfortunately we do&nbsp;
have to wrap up i feel like we could talk for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:21.760
another 40 minutes so first I want to thank Daario&nbsp;
for spending time with us today thank you Dario

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:28.880
i also want to thank all of you who are here&nbsp;
in person and those watching via liveream uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:34.000
but before we close I almost forgot one thing um&nbsp;
as a special thank you to everyone who joined us&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.840
today at Code with Cloud in person i'm excited&nbsp;
to announce that each of you will receive free&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:46.240
access to Max 20X our highest tier plan&nbsp;
for three months so look out for that

01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:53.360
i especially love using Macs with cloud&nbsp;
code so you'll be able to do that as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:56.880
so we can't wait to see what you build have&nbsp;
a great rest of your day with the different&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:08.880
um sessions and welcome again to Code with Claude&nbsp;
thanks for coming thanks for coming everyone
