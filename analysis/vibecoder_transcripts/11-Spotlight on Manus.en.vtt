00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.000
My name is Tao and my nick is hik you can just&nbsp;
find me on any social network with medic high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.720
cloud and right now I'm the co-founder of manasai&nbsp;
and I'm acting our chief product officer but you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.360
know I'm not just a product guy I coding for&nbsp;
like 28 years from my very early age like when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.320
I was nine I I can't remember but you know for&nbsp;
AI actually I'm very newbie I just into this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.840
industry for only two years and uh uh what I want&nbsp;
to achieve in the AI industry is like I want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.720
build a product that can you know influence 24&nbsp;
hours for a single user that is two years ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.080
that is my dream but right now I think with manus&nbsp;
AI actually I can achieve that dream at end of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.520
this year right Now the maximum usage for our user&nbsp;
there's one single user uh he can just consume the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:13.040
GPD GPU power two hours per day just for himself.&nbsp;
So I think we can achieve this goal at end of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.240
year and today uh what I want to talk about is&nbsp;
about two things uh one is about manners and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.760
another thing is about cloud models. So the first&nbsp;
talk is about what is manas. Yeah, man. Actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.080
you know, it's some not like an English word. Uh&nbsp;
because really it isn't. Yeah, man. This name just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:40.080
comes from MIT's motto which is men's at manas.&nbsp;
It's a old Latin words which means man and hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.160
Why we choose this name manas? Mess is the hand&nbsp;
is because we think for like all the past two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.800
years all these frontier models they're already&nbsp;
like very smart just like uh humans brain. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.800
They're super smart. they are capable of like&nbsp;
doing different kind of of tasks but you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.640
even with this very very smart brain we can&nbsp;
make a real impact into the real world because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.680
we don't build hands for it you know just like&nbsp;
when I was nine at that time that is like 1996&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.040
uh back in China and at that time our families&nbsp;
are not you know we are not rich enough to have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.200
computer in each of our family so I only have like&nbsp;
two times a week uh to go to the computer room in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.440
our in my primary school and at that time even&nbsp;
I was the best in the class of of of of coding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.440
but without going to the computer to like debug uh&nbsp;
to to write the code on the on the real machine I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.840
can't get the code right just in one time with a&nbsp;
pen and a paper but you know that's exactly what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.520
we did for the past two years we have a very smart&nbsp;
man but we only give it a pen and a paper and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:59.120
ask them to solve very complex programs for us. So&nbsp;
we think that's a program. So in manas we we don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.200
train models. We don't even like post training&nbsp;
models. What we do is like we are building hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.800
for these models. Yeah, that is you know the&nbsp;
the concept be behind our lane manas. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:21.040
I think like most of you maybe uh saw our product&nbsp;
man on social or you already a man user and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.040
must like saw some use cases on our website&nbsp;
any like social network but today I also want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.680
to like just share like two uh new use cases one&nbsp;
from our internal usage another is from our user.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.200
Yeah. So this one is actually from our internal&nbsp;
usage. Yeah because we are expanding globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.720
We just opened our Singapore office three weeks&nbsp;
ago and opened our Tokyo office two weeks ago and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.040
we will open our San Francisco office tomorrow.&nbsp;
Yeah. So when we are choosing our Tokyo office,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.960
uh we are asking man to help us. It's like&nbsp;
we will say okay we have like a 40 people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.200
uh we'll be relocating to Tokyo. So just find the&nbsp;
office we can which can fit 40 people and also we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.840
have to solve their accommodation problem. So this&nbsp;
is a this is a prompt we give to manus and after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.080
we give this prompt to manus manus just have&nbsp;
its own plan and then executes the plan. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.880
like search browse all these websites around the&nbsp;
internet doing a lot of browsing browsing browsing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:31.040
research research research and after 24 minutes&nbsp;
man just uh uh deliver this website for us. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.040
this website it says a Tokyo office accommodation&nbsp;
recommendations. It first it comes with a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.680
interactive map which comes all the 10 options&nbsp;
matt found for us. The blue marker is for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.840
offic's location and the green marker is the&nbsp;
accommodation near that office. All these 10&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.680
options just on this interactive map. Yeah. And&nbsp;
if you keep scrolling down you can see the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.920
pair is a Shibuya one. It choose the Shibuya&nbsp;
scramble square. That's exactly the office we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.800
went to when when we are looking office there.&nbsp;
But you know this office is kind of like very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.160
fancy but too expensive for startup like us. So&nbsp;
we just choose our office dear this dear near de&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.440
near de near de near de near de near de near de&nbsp;
near de near de near de near this this one very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.960
very dear very very close like maybe 200 meters&nbsp;
away and it has the price and why we should choose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.920
this office and if you we choose this office uh&nbsp;
what the commenation uh options we can get also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:32.640
has the distance to the office which is very great&nbsp;
comes with like 10 pairs of the and at the bottom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.720
there's like an overview table for all these&nbsp;
options yeah so all these have been done just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.040
under 20 minutes. So you can imagine maybe like&nbsp;
your your inter or your assistant can achieve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:51.040
such detailed quantity of uh of information uh&nbsp;
in such a short time. Another thing I want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:58.080
demo here is like yeah you can just maybe send&nbsp;
an image to manus uh empty room and ask manus to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.320
analyze this rule style and go to EKS website&nbsp;
to find some furnitureures for your room and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:11.280
then you can see the final result. Yeah. So look&nbsp;
first manus will just analyze uh this empty rules&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:18.400
image and come up with idea okay this uh what&nbsp;
what what style of this of this rule and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.800
layout and what kind of furnitureures I should&nbsp;
look look up in the EKS website and then M just go&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:31.200
to EKS website and start browsing browsing for all&nbsp;
these furnitureures and save these furnitureures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:40.720
images and then at last man will just return an&nbsp;
image just with the real EKA furniture and also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:47.920
with a document with all the furniture he choose&nbsp;
to like uh comband in this image with the link so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.280
actually you can just click click the link to buy&nbsp;
it yeah right now we can't buy things for you but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.520
who knows after three months yeah maybe we can do&nbsp;
payment yeah so that is kind of the things mass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.520
can do yeah it's like a a general agent yeah they&nbsp;
can solve a very long tale of different type of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:13.040
tasks for you. Yeah. So we can jump back to the uh&nbsp;
slides. Yeah. So that is like kind of like what is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.760
manas and today I think the most I want to share&nbsp;
is like how we built manas. Yeah. Cursor just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.960
inspired us a lot. We got a lot of inspirations&nbsp;
from cursor. I think you may sound weird because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.560
cursor is kind of like a code editor you know.&nbsp;
Yeah. So all three founders of manas like pig,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.200
red and I we're all coders for a lot of years.&nbsp;
So when we are using cursor I think cursor is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.960
actually very great product. It can help us to&nbsp;
write different language even we don't know how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:46.880
to code in this language and it's very like&nbsp;
like efficiency but the most interesting part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:54.080
is not we coders using uh using cursor the&nbsp;
most interesting part is when we watch our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:00.080
friends our colleagues which are long coders&nbsp;
watching they using cursor to solve their daily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:07.120
tasks like doing data visualization batch file&nbsp;
processing convert a video file into an audio file&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.720
It's very fascinating because you know this is&nbsp;
the the interface of cursor right when these long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:19.040
coders using cursor they don't care about the&nbsp;
left side because they they can't evaluate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:26.720
code at all they can do is just keep the accept&nbsp;
accept accept accept accept you know yeah so it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:33.040
very interesting when watching the those friends&nbsp;
you know using cursor so we we just come up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:40.160
idea which is that those l programmers just using&nbsp;
cursor to deal with their daily tasks. Yeah. Not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.360
like us, you know, when we are using cursor,&nbsp;
we really want to write some code, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.960
that can run multiple times for the future. But&nbsp;
for this friend, they just want cursor to solve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:56.000
their task. They don't care about the code. Next&nbsp;
time when they have the same task, they will not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.520
run that code again. They will just ask a cursor&nbsp;
to do that. Maybe generate a new code for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:07.520
So code is is like maybe not the ultimate goal.&nbsp;
It's just you know just an intermediate step for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:13.760
solving problems. So we come up with idea is that&nbsp;
maybe we should build the opposite. Yeah we should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:20.000
build the right panel of cursor and another thing&nbsp;
we want to build is that we want the right panel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.640
to running in the cloud. Why is that? Because&nbsp;
you know when we are using cursor on our computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:33.360
there's it has to ask your permission to to&nbsp;
continue because it is running on on your computer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:40.720
any action it perform on your computer is like&nbsp;
will may be dangerous right after it maybe it will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:47.840
install some dependencies install some software&nbsp;
it may break your computer but we think if it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:54.720
running in the cloud it's much safer and also when&nbsp;
it's running in the cloud you don't have to pay&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:00.000
your attention to it you just you know assign&nbsp;
a task to manus you can just close your laptop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.760
or just put your phone back to your pocket you&nbsp;
can do other thing and after the task is done we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:13.520
will give you a notification and you will get the&nbsp;
result yeah so that's the original idea of how we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:21.760
come up with idea of the manus that is happening&nbsp;
last October so from last October to this March&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:28.880
five months of work. This is what you saw today.&nbsp;
Uh which is the manusi in fifth of March. Yeah. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.800
that's the original idea. Yeah. Thank you guy. And&nbsp;
also I want to share some details when we building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.880
manus. What kind of source we have in our man.&nbsp;
The first is that the first key component of manus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:48.320
is that we give manus a computer which is super&nbsp;
important when you compare to other chatbot usage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:54.240
because you know in manas each manus t will be&nbsp;
assigned a fully functional virtual machine manus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.240 --> 00:11:01.120
can use the file system terminal vs code and a&nbsp;
real chromium browser you know it's not a headless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:07.040
browser yeah all these apps in a virtual machine&nbsp;
which you know it it creates a lot of different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:12.720
opportunity for manus to solve different kinds&nbsp;
of problem like you can just drag you can just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:21.840
send a zip compress file contains maybe hundreds&nbsp;
of of PDFs and ask manus to un unzip it and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:28.080
uh extract all these unstructured data from these&nbsp;
hundreds of PDFs into a structured spreadsheet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.920
yeah that's the thing you can do so we think&nbsp;
give it a computer is actually what make matters&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.600
really different comparing to other agents or&nbsp;
other chat bots and the second thing is that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.960
think you know nowadays it's not it's not every&nbsp;
information or data is on the public internet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:51.280
there are so many things under pay behind pay or&nbsp;
in this private databases but users because man&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.920
you know we are targeting to the consumer market&nbsp;
we're not targeting to the enterprise market so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:02.080
for for an average user who is not very familiar&nbsp;
of like how to call an API you know how to write&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:09.280
code to access databases we think it's better for&nbsp;
us to prepay all these like private databases APIs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:15.440
for the users then users want won't care how they&nbsp;
can get maybe some real-time financial data yeah&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:21.520
things like that so it's like we pre we prepare&nbsp;
this uh private databases for our users and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:28.160
third thing is that in manus actually you can&nbsp;
just teach manus how to solve programs like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:34.000
uh one month before we release manus check GBT&nbsp;
just released their deep research so there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.280
experience actually I don't like it's like you ask&nbsp;
a question to deep research it will returns five&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.920
or six questions for you know I don't I don't&nbsp;
think that's a very good experience because I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.280
want you to solve task for me not asking me more&nbsp;
questions but you know some of our colleagues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:55.360
someone in our team they like this experience so&nbsp;
we have an internal discussion about whether we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.640
we should do something maybe like a workflow&nbsp;
or maybe like a hard code things to deliver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:07.280
such experience but instead we didn't do that we&nbsp;
implemented a personal logic system which is like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:13.280
you can just teach manus next time when you are&nbsp;
go out to do some research before you do before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:20.160
you start just confirm all the details with me and&nbsp;
then executes it then manus will once you accept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:26.240
that knowledge into your personal knowledge&nbsp;
system man will remembers it and it will just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.840
uh acts like you know every time when it want to&nbsp;
do some research it will confirm with you first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:38.640
and then exit it I think all these three just&nbsp;
makes management really powerful but I think the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:43.520
most important part because if you want to build&nbsp;
an agent all these three reasoning I think maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:51.040
you you definitely will give it a try but we think&nbsp;
why the magic happens why man is such a a great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:56.800
experience the most important part is not about&nbsp;
these three components we think the most important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:04.640
part is that at the fundamental concept of manners&nbsp;
we have this less structure more intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.880
you can defend this sentence at the bottom of&nbsp;
our official website. We just you know we just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:14.160
believe in this. We we we take so much faith&nbsp;
in in it. And how do we define net structure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:21.200
more intelligence is that when we release manus&nbsp;
actually we put 42 use cases on our website and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:28.160
someone say okay man is is is not a saying you&nbsp;
just uh uh predefine some workflows maybe you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:34.320
have like 42 predefined workflows but actually&nbsp;
you know inside manus in the core of manus we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:41.760
zero predefined workflows it's just a very simple&nbsp;
but very robust structure very simple structure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:48.000
But we just left all the intelligence part to the&nbsp;
foundational model. At that time it is cloud sol&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.520
3.7 and now we have cloud 4 right. So what we are&nbsp;
doing is like because we are building the hands&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:03.360
right it's like we just compose all these context&nbsp;
to build them into like a more good structure and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:09.440
then we provide more context to the model and we&nbsp;
have less control. When I say license control,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:15.520
I mean multi-roll agent system, right? You have&nbsp;
to specify this a coding agent, this is a search&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:21.360
agent, this is blah blah blah agent. We think all&nbsp;
these kind of phones are a control. It just limits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:27.600
the real potential of LMS. So for us, it's like we&nbsp;
just provide more context to the to the model and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:35.040
the net the model uh to like improise by itself.&nbsp;
And uh all this magic you get from manas just come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:43.040
from this very simple but very strong ideology is&nbsp;
less structure more intelligence. Yeah. So that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:51.840
is the secret behind manas and why we choose cloud&nbsp;
in the first place is for three reasons. The first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:59.200
one is about the long horizon planning. You know&nbsp;
I think before cloud sol models because because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:06.960
chatbot is just so successful. So all these models&nbsp;
out out there uh maybe before before this March&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:15.680
are post train and align their alignments is for&nbsp;
chatboard scenario and in chatboard scenario the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.960
model intends to answer your question in one&nbsp;
turn is that you ask the question and you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:28.080
the answer but you know in agentic scenarios&nbsp;
like in manners an average task will take maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:34.320
30 or 50 steps and then get the final answer.&nbsp;
So when we are building manus actually we try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:43.680
every model we can get our hands on but it finds&nbsp;
out only sonet can know okay I imaging a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:50.640
giant agentic loop so I should perform the action&nbsp;
watch the observation and decide what's the action&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:57.360
observation abs observation it's just a very giant&nbsp;
agentic loop so just so know okay I'm in this loop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:03.280
so I have to gather more information before I&nbsp;
delivers a final result. But you know for these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:10.160
five months we try all other models all of them&nbsp;
failed after maybe only one two three iterations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:16.640
those models will think that okay I think it's&nbsp;
enough I will answer your questions right now so I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:23.680
think that's a problem and right now what we found&nbsp;
the best model to run a very long horizon planning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:29.440
sc is cloud solenance models that is the first&nbsp;
thing why we choose cloud and for second part is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:37.040
about the tool use because you agent product just&nbsp;
heavily relied on the tool use on the function&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.960
calling. Yeah, like for us we just abstract&nbsp;
all these tools in that virtual machine. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:49.120
have like 27 tools in the virtual machine. So the&nbsp;
agent framework has to decide what's the action&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.480
should be performed into that virtual machine.&nbsp;
So it's it's very important to call the right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.480 --> 00:18:02.720
tool and write the tools parameters uh right. So&nbsp;
at that time when we are building manus we don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:10.080
have the sync tool in cloud models. So we kind&nbsp;
of like implemented some mechanism by our own we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:18.400
call it coot injection which is like before every&nbsp;
function call we just will use another specific we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.120
call the planner agent to do the reasoning at that&nbsp;
time we don't have reasoning too. Yeah because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:29.440
that's that's the three 3.5. Yeah. So we have to&nbsp;
do the reasoning by oursel and then we inject that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:36.720
reasoning that coot into the main agent and then&nbsp;
we perform that function call and what we found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:43.280
out it's just boost the performance of function&nbsp;
calling and also in an article anoroptical release&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:49.520
at end of March with the sync tool they also&nbsp;
found out this and in cloud 4 it kind of has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:55.760
some like a native support for the uh syncing in&nbsp;
the tool use I think you you guys all say in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:02.080
morning's session. Yeah. So that's the second one.&nbsp;
And the for third one is like we think is model&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:07.600
maybe the best they have the best alignment with&nbsp;
agentic usage because you know in agentic usage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:15.440
we have to deal with the browser the computer I&nbsp;
think as put so much resources on the alignment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:22.640
with the computer use the browser you see so which&nbsp;
makes cloud model maybe the best model uh to build&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:30.160
agents that's why we choose astropical models for&nbsp;
manness and also you know we just spend a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:37.360
tokens on M on cloud and the whistle. This is the&nbsp;
t-shirt I wear in the GTC event. We just wear this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:44.240
this this shirt in a GTC event. Yeah, we spend&nbsp;
like $1 million on cloud model in the first 14&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.440
days. I think maybe that's why they they invited&nbsp;
us here to to give the speed. Yeah, it cost us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:56.240
a lot to be on the stage, you know. Yeah. So,&nbsp;
that's the whole story about the manner so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:02.160
Yeah. So if you have questions, you can just line&nbsp;
up at the two mics. We gonna start from right to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:22.160
left. Yeah. Each by each. Yeah. Any questions?&nbsp;
Yeah. [Applause] Cool. Oh yeah, there's one.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.160
Hello. Thanks for the presentation. Very&nbsp;
interesting. So um I don't know how much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:33.280
you can share but uh I was just curious about&nbsp;
uh in your uh agentic workflow uh especially the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:41.760
browser part how much is that uh vision and how&nbsp;
much is that actually you know parsing the code of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:48.160
the web page right so how much of it is like the&nbsp;
model looking at the browser like a person would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.760
uh and how much of that is that is more like&nbsp;
text type of interaction if that makes sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:01.520
Uh sorry I I may I may to I may get the question.&nbsp;
It's like a so when you when the the manus uses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.480
the web browser right? Oh yeah yeah yeah it goes&nbsp;
on the on a website right and how much of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.200
understanding of the web page oh is based on the&nbsp;
vision yeah I got your question how much is based&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.200
on the yeah yeah yeah that's a very good question&nbsp;
I actually I can share it's it's not a secret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:21.680
because you know yeah uh um when we are building&nbsp;
mass from last October there is an open open&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:26.160
source project called browser use I think most of&nbsp;
you guys maybe know that project so we just take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:32.160
a look at that project we think their way of how&nbsp;
to talk to the browsers is actually very useful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:38.080
So we just use that part because you know two&nbsp;
months is later browser use has its own agent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:42.880
framework. We don't use that part. We don't&nbsp;
use that agent framework bar. We only use the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:49.200
protocol they talk to the browsers. So the&nbsp;
thing we are sending to the uh the context&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.320
we're sending to the foundational model when&nbsp;
we when is browsing internet are three things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:02.560
The first is the text in this viewport. We will&nbsp;
send it to to uh cloud. And the second thing is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:08.880
screenshot. Yeah. In in this viewport. And the&nbsp;
third thing is a screenshot but with bounding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:14.880
boxes. You know then the model can decide which&nbsp;
area he should click. Yeah. So right now we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.760
just share this reason to the model. Yeah. I&nbsp;
don't know if I answer your question. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:27.120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Cool. Oh yeah.&nbsp;
Another one. Hi uh I have a slightly controversial&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:32.560
question but I I want to kind of put put this out&nbsp;
to you. Yeah. uh with the advancement of lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:39.920
these foundational model and the deep research&nbsp;
capability, how do you see a rapper company kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:46.160
of keeping their edge like what how do you see&nbsp;
it sort of what are the research area what are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:51.360
the areas that you're concerned about what are you&nbsp;
focused so that you can actually grow in parallel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.560
with these foundational model as their capability&nbsp;
increases definitely I I kind of get your question&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:02.400
because you know we answer this question for the&nbsp;
past two months to a lot of investors you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:07.520
yeah they are all asking okay what's your mode&nbsp;
being as a rapper you know yeah things like that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:14.640
um we think you know there will be no mode just&nbsp;
for some very specific technology or framework&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:20.640
because technology will be out of data very very&nbsp;
very fast even for models right so we think the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:27.360
only thing we can win this competition is about&nbsp;
the pace of innovation like what you mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:32.480
there's like a a use case like deep research&nbsp;
deep deep research is one of the main use case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:38.640
in manus we have like maybe 20% of users are doing&nbsp;
deep research every day on manas but you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:46.800
actually we put zero effort on deep research use&nbsp;
cases like I just mentioned we just build a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:53.440
simple structure a very simple agent framework&nbsp;
the deep research capability is just emergence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:59.680
from this framework which means you know maybe&nbsp;
open AI they need maybe half a year to do the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:04.560
end to end training just for this specific use&nbsp;
cases. But this capability just you know just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:11.200
emerges from from the whole structure. So in six&nbsp;
months is maybe we will have like a hundreds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:18.720
use cases like deep research and and also what we&nbsp;
can do is like we can leverage the best model in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:24.960
the world. Yeah. You know I I I think these are&nbsp;
two things. It's about the flexibility of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:30.160
whole agent framework and the second thing is like&nbsp;
we are really flexible of choosing the best model&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:37.280
in the world. Yeah. All right. Thank you. Okay.&nbsp;
Yeah. Hi. Hello. Hi. Hello. Question. Uh so uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:43.680
right now maybe the last question. Sorry. Uh turn&nbsp;
around. Yeah. Okay. Um so right now you build the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:50.400
uh browser in a virtual environment. Are you&nbsp;
planning to put uh the browser in a docker in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.440
the local computer and later they can use the&nbsp;
local cookie and access all the account? Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:59.360
actually we we don't have plan for local&nbsp;
environment because as I just mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:06.240
we think it's very important to like give the&nbsp;
users attention back to users. We don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.560
like user to pay attention still to his phone&nbsp;
or to his computer. We want everything to run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:16.000
in the cloud. And we we we don't just have a a&nbsp;
Linux virtual machine. We still we we also have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.280
plan to have a virtual Windows virtual Android&nbsp;
for manus to to run in the future. So it's all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:34.960
about running in the cloud. Yeah. Okay. I think&nbsp;
my time is up. Thanks for guys for today. Yeah. Uh
