# VibeCoders Bootcamp 2.0: AI-Powered Engineering

## üöÄ The New Paradigm: Code WITH AI, Not Against It

Transform from traditional "copy-paste" coder to AI-powered engineer who understands both the "vibe" and the "science" of modern development.

---

## Bootcamp Philosophy

**"Work it until you solve it... with AI as your pair programmer"**

We're not replacing engineering fundamentals - we're augmenting them with AI capabilities. Learn when to "vibe code" for rapid prototyping and when to engineer for production stability.
